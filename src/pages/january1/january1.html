          <p>When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed, when you are discouraged thinking all is lost, count your many blessings, name them one by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your blessings, see what God has done! </p><p>
              Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your many blessings, see what God has done and it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</p><p>
              We ought not to forget the works and wonders of God, in our life in years past. His goodness and faithfulness has kept and preserve us. Being thankful isn’t just for gratitude sake. Scripture tells us to be thankful in everything, in all circumstances. Perhaps you have lost your job recently, or you may have lost your health, or a loved one, separated from friends, unjustly accused, brutally treated, if even a person had a right to complain, it is you. Such circumstances can be tremendously difficult. But even so, we all have much to be thankful for. Instead of complaints, let your lips ring with words of praise and thanksgiving to God. This attitude of thankfulness is what will see us through all the trials and tribulations of life in this New Year. Let thanksgiving to God be a daily reality that will change your life and make you a joyful person in every situation this year. Nothing turns us into bitter selfish dissatisfied people more quickly than an ungrateful heart. And nothing will do more to restore contentment and the joy of our salvation than a true spirit of thankfulness.

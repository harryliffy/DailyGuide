JANUARY � APRIL 2018






JANUARY 1				      BEGINNING WITH GOD IN THANKSGIVING											
																														SCRIPTURE READING: PSALM 100:1-5 
																																KEY VERSE: I THESSALONIANS 5:18
							Give thanks in all circumstances, for that is God�s will for you in Christ Jesus.

When upon life�s billows you are tempest tossed, when you are discouraged thinking all is lost, count your many blessings, name them one by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your blessings, see what God has done! 
Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your many blessings, see what God has done and it will surprise you what the Lord has done.
We ought not to forget the works and wonders of God, in our life in years past. His goodness and faithfulness has kept and preserve us. Being thankful isn�t just for gratitude sake. Scripture tells us to be thankful in everything, in all circumstances. Perhaps you have lost your job recently, or you may have lost your health, or a loved one, separated from friends, unjustly accused, brutally treated, if even a person had a right to complain, it is you. Such circumstances can be tremendously difficult. But even so, we all have much to be thankful for. Instead of complaints, let your lips ring with words of praise and thanksgiving to God. This attitude of thankfulness is what will see us through all the trials and tribulations of life in this New Year. Let thanksgiving to God be a daily reality that will change your life and make you a joyful person in every situation this year. Nothing turns us into bitter selfish dissatisfied people more quickly than an ungrateful heart. And nothing will do more to restore contentment and the joy of our salvation than a true spirit of thankfulness.

Prayer
Praise God! Lord, grant me the attitude of praise as you reveal your glory anew this year in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















JANUARY 2				                                         A FRESH START														                  SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 43:18-19 
																																KEY VERSE: PSALM 65:11	
						Thou crownest the year with thy goodness.

A fresh start gives us a chance to reinvent our lives and ourselves, to shed the baggage of the previous year. It often feels great. Filled with excitement and relief, we get to leave the past behind and enter into a new system with great anticipation, hope and promise, with a new vision.
But for some, beginnings can feel treacherous. Letting go of comfortable, established relationships, family, homes and jobs can force us to confront anxiety, uncertainty and even fear of the unknown.
A fresh start demands a clean slate. Let everything from the past go. Clear your plate and your palate. Let go of failure, fears you�ve built up. Decide what matters most today, to you, your life. What are you most passionate about? What excites and invigorates you? What would give you the most fulfilment?
Clear away distractions and focus. Find happiness now. Don�t look at happiness as something that will come when you�ve attained a certain accomplishment or certain amount of wealth or material goods. Happiness is possible right now. You have a fresh start. Let go of last year, and start anew. Our certainty and security is found in God. To him, we must cling as we journey forth over every low and valley ahead. 

Prayer 
As I start afresh this year help me stay focus on you. Work on my anxiety and unbelief for the fulfilment of your glory in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















JANUARY 3			                                             WHO GOD SAYS YOU ARE														                  SCRIPTURE READING: PSALM 139:13-18 
																																KEY VERSE: PSALM 139:14
							I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

Learning to confess your faith, and then let that confession lead to life a change so it demolishes your old way of thinking and gives you a new way of thinking about life, God, yourself, hardship, your family and your world. Open your mind to what God says you are. Say the same thing God says about you. Let it change the way you live.
Start everyday by confessing some things the Bible says about you that need to become things you say about yourself.
Here is a list of biblical affirmations about our identity in Jesus Christ. This is just a portion of many truths about who we have become through faith in God, but it is powerful inventory to review from time to time.
I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Psalm 139:14
I am crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. 
						Galatians 2:20
I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength. Philippians 4:13
He who began a good work in me will be faithful to complete it. Phil.1:6
In all things God works for the good for those who love in him. Romans 8:28
For God has not given me a spirit of fear but of power and love and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1:7
When you say what God says, you begin to think what God thinks. So let this be your confession of faith. And let it be the foundation on which you build your life.
This is not the power of positive thinking. It�s not your good thoughts that will turn your life around. He�s just asking you to believe, he is who he says you are, and then live like you believe those things.

Prayer
Lord let me experience the fulfilment of your words in my life and make my heart open to          who you say I am in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

JANUARY 4			 	                    THE GOOD SHEPHERD

																														SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 10:1-18
																																KEY VERSE: JOHN 10:11
							I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

A shepherd is someone that looks after flocks or lamb. This is very challenging and demanding. This is because he has to make sure the sheep are properly taking care of and they are safe from any form of attack by the predator. David is a good example of a shepherd. He was helping his father flocks to find pasture in the hot Palestinian desert. Suddenly, a lion appear from a nearby bush and grabbed one of the sheep. David went after the lion and kills it. At another time, a bear came and grabbed the sheep but David did not hesitate to attack the bear and kill it as well.
What makes Jesus a good shepherd was that He laid down his life for you as a Lamb of God that died for your sin. He care so much for as many soul that surrender their life to him. Accept him as your savior and Lord today and He will put you among his sheep and also take care of you like the shepherd cares for the sheep.

Prayer
Lord I embrace the path you are leading me for the salvation of my soul and the enlargement of your kingdom in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

























JANUARY 5					       TREASURE IN A CLAY JAR

																														SCRIPTURE READING: 2 CORINTHIANS 4:2-15
																																KEY VERSE: 2 CORINTHIANS 4:15
						We are troubled on every side, yet not distress; we are perplexed, but not despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroy.

Treasure are valuables or something special and it is certain that things like this will be kept in a safe place that is secure from being damage or stolen. This is going to be protected irrespective of any challenges or attack. There are lots of things to be treasure by man and some of them are money, children, certificate or properties to mention but few. However, today scripture gives a different context of treasure. Paul referred to the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ as a treasure. 
There is no price to be placed on the privilege of receiving Jesus as savior and having eternal destiny settled. The great treasure of salvation is found in earthen vessel or clay jar. As a Christian, you have the message and you are to share with others. Matthew 28:19. Christian�s physical body is subjected to trial but the power of God could be manifested through this earthly vessel. Do you have this treasure we talked about? Search your heart and do the right thing by making yourself available to be the clay jar. The treasure is priceless, don�t lose it.

Prayer
Lord, give the power of enablement to treasure your gift salvation and to bring other the light of your kingdom in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.






















JANUARY 6	                                                                ASK FOR WISDOM
	
								SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERB 4:1-7
																																KEY VERSE: JAMES 1:5
								If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

Wisdom is the ability to make wise decisions in difficult circumstances. It means practical discernment. Wisdom can be passed on from generation to generation. Ultimately, of course, all wisdom comes from God .God is willing to give this wisdom but we will be unable to receive it if our goals are self-centred instead of God�s centred. 
Christians don�t have to go around in dark, hoping to stumble upon answers. We can ask God for wisdom to guide our choices. If you want wisdom you must decide to go after it. It takes resolve, a determination not to abandon the search once you begin no matter how difficult the road may become. This is not a once in a lifetime step, but a daily process. Nothing else is more important or more valuable.
Wisdom is knowing how to live God�s way in God�s world. It pleases God when we ask for wisdom, its Gods nature to give. Ask God who gives, he doesn�t run out of energy. He keeps on giving generously. God resources are unlimited. He has enough resources for everyone, he also gives cheerfully. Don�t ever get ashamed to ask.

Prayer 
Lord, I seek your ever present wisdom to help brighten my path and help make the right decisions in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















JANUARY 7	                                                  REBUILDING A SHATTERED IDENTITY 
	
								SCRIPTURE READING: I CHRONICLE 4:9-10
																																KEY VERSE: I CHRONICLE 4:10
							And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.

It doesn�t matter how old you are or how far you have come, once we realise our image has been shattered by our action or situation we need to start over. We have seen parents who damage their name and it become difficult for their generation to associate with their name.
Your Identity is your destination so far.  No matter what happens, once you are still alive there is still time to rebuild. 
Jabez was a man conceived, bore in pain and his name was erased from his family history. Is a man with a beautiful past and no hope for a future. He began his life with a stigma. A man whose struggles to find meaning and significant in life. But most of all he craves a relationship with God. Jabez turns out to be more than obscure man in a forgotten time.  His future did not look bright but he decided that he was not going to spend the rest of his life in this pitiable condition. He called on the Lord to change his destiny. He knew that God could transform his life completely. He did not seek promotion and favour from men. He calls upon the Lord, to rebuild his shattered identity. 
The presence of the Lord in your life is of great importance, for it assures victory, turnaround and safe guidance in the journey of life. Seek God guidance as to know the areas you need to deal with, faithfully follow the instructions and he would give your life a meaning. 

Prayer
Lord, help correct the area in my life were my identity has been scattered and thrown into the mould for the revealing of your glory in Jesus Christ  Almighty name. Amen.
















JANUARY 8     			                                         GOD IN EVERYTHING														                  SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 1:1-28
																																KEY VERSE: PSALM 139:2
							Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.

The word �God in everything� means the complete knowledge of God over everything, in, on, outside, beneath, above, within and over your life as living. He brings about order in a universe of chaos. He is in everything because he created everything and has complete dominion over it.
From the text, we know that through creation, God is in everything consisting of both the world and man. Psalm 24:1. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God; everything is exposed before his eyes.
There is a question we need to ask ourselves, �Do you look for God in everything�? �do you know that you have everything in God more than you can count?� even in your thoughts�. Psalm 139:2b-end. �Is God your spare tyre or your steering wheel?�

Prayer
Lord, I accept your lawship over my life and I enforce your will on every area of my life, in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


























JANUARY 9			                                              A POSITIVE MIND

								SCRIPTURE READING: PHILIPIANS 4:8-9
																																KEY VERSE: PROVERBS 4:23
							Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.				                    
How often do we wonder about what we should think or focus our mind on during the process of the day? We tend to focus and consider how often we find our whole attitude in a wrong direction, by we  managing what could happen in a situation, that when we actually experience it, we are flustered by what we have been thinking.
There is place for a positive mind which is equivalent to your thought because your mind thinks but this mind is positive only when you have discovered a positive life, a life in Christ.
In as much as Christ showed us that the secret of a positive mind dwells within, we are going to manifest what we dwell in mentally. Do you know what creates the greatest amount of negative thoughts in our lives? It is the drawing of premature and negative conclusion about the circumstance of life. We can choose to focus on the service we can extend if we endure positively and take pride in the product we produce or enjoy life and have fun or main negative.
Sure, there is more to learn, but hopefully we have enough to set our mind on. �Do we think as the word says or as the world says even when the battle gets tough?� 

	Prayer
Lord, purify the thought of my heart, let your living water cleanse me from every negative thought, in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen. 




















JANUARY 10			                   TAKING DOWN THE GIANT														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 17:20-26 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 17:26
							Then David spoke to the men who stood by him saying, what shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and take away the reproach from Israel�s for who is it uncircumcised Philistine, that he should delay the armies of the living God. 
	
What a victory it was as David boldly defeated the giant Goliath, armed only with a sling shot and five smooth stores. The will of the Philistines was broken. And it was all because a little shepherd boy answered the call of God and cut down the giant.
While is true we all have giants, it is also true that every giant can be defeated. After all, giants rarely start out that way. Goliath was not always a giant. He was not always a feet 6 inches tall. He was once a baby. And with the passing of time and nurture of others, the baby became a child. And the child became a teenager, and the teenager became a man, and the man turned into a giant. In time little things become big things.
Your Goliath doesn�t carry sword or shovel, he brandishes blades of unemployment, abandonment, seasonal abuse or depression. Your giant doesn�t parade up and down the hills of Elah, he prances through your office, your bedroom, classroom. He brings bills you can�t pay, grades you can�t make, people you can�t please, whiskey you can resist, pornography you can�t refuse, a past you can�t shake, and a future you can�t face. You know well the roar of Goliath. First thought of the morning, last worry of the night, your Goliath dominates your day and infiltrates your joy. But just like David you can face your giant, even if you aren�t the strongest, the smallest, the best equipped, or the holiest. David took five stones. He made five decisions. Do likewise, past, prayer, priority, passion and persistence. Focus on giants. You stumble; focus on God- your Giants tumble.

Prayer
Lord I pray that the same anointing that came upon David and enabled him to kill Goliath will rest upon me and silence every adversaries in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.





			







JANUARY 11			                      THE STONE OF THE PAST														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 17:31-37 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 17:36	
								Your servant has killed both lion and bear and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God 

Though the Israelites feared losing to Goliath, they forgot who had called them to enter the Promised Land. Though they had seen God fight for them in many previous battles, they neglected to trust him in this one. Goliath jogged David�s memory while everyone else was vibrating, David remembered God had given him strength to wrestle a lion and strong-arm a bear.
A good memory makes heroes. A bad memory makes wimps. Whenever your giant awoke you with a woeful list of worries and ridicule, remember David, the story of the lion and the bear. Do what David did, gaze at God�s victories, pulled out your journal and began making a list of lion and bear size conquests.   
Remember his marvellous works which he has done. 1 Chronicles.16:12 catalogue God�s success. Keep a list of his world records. Has he not walked you through high waters? Proven to be faithful? Have you not known his provision? Write today�s worries in sand. Chisel yesterday�s victories in stone. Pick up the stone of the past.
What battle are you facing this week? Even if it�s bigger than you can handle, it�s not bigger than God can handle. Proceed with his backing.

Prayer
Lord, let your victories in the past bring forth testimonies in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.   
			













JANUARY 12				    THE STONE OF THE PRAYER														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 17:41-45 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 17:45
							Then David said to the Philistine, you come with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the nam e of the LORD of hosts; the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 
	
The need to realise that the battle belongs to the Lord, is of most important in taking down our giants. The reason why giants defeat us again and again is because we face them in our own strength and we lose.
Note the valley between your thumb and finger. To pass from one to the next you must go through it. Let it remind you of David descent. Before going high, David went low, before ascending to fight. David descended to prepare. Don�t face your giant without first doing the same. Dedicate time to pray. Call on God for his power, trust in him. Don�t look at God in the light of your giant. Instead, look at your giant in the light of God.
Giants! We must face them. Yet we need not face them alone. Focus first, and must on God. Lift your eyes, giant slayers, the God who made a miracle out of David stands ready to make one out of you.
Attack your giant with prayer. Goliath had come into the actual territory of the Israelites. He had crossed the line. He was taunting them. And if tolerate a Goliath, he will take over your territory. He will come right up on your doorstep. That is why you don�t run from giants. You don�t negotiate with them. Whatever your giant may be, force it into the light of day. Stop rationalizing it. Stop excusing it. Realize you can�t defeat it in your own strength. 

Prayer
Lord, conquer every spirit of laziness in prayer and strengthen me to wait on you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















JANUARY 13	              		                   THE STONE OF PRIORITY														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 17:46-47 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 17:47
							Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord�s and he will give you into our hands.	

Let your tallest finger remind you of your highest priority, God�s reputation. David jealously guarded it. No one was going to defame his Lord. David fought so that �all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. He knew God�s attributes as expressed by his names, trusted what they taught him, and conducted his life accordingly. David trusted God to intervene in the affairs of men.
Consider what David did in light of a modern circumstance when car needs repair, we take it to the person who has the title �auto mechanic�, and we do not take it to the dentist. In like manner, we are to seek God in our need in areas in which he has revealed himself to us as a skilled and willing to help.
David saw Goliath as a chance for God to show off. He was willing to give his life for the reputation of God. What if you saw your giant in the same manner? Rather than begrudge him, welcome him your sickness is God�s chance to flex his healing muscles. Your sin is God�s opportunity to showcase grace, your struggling marriage can bill board God�s power. See your struggles as God�s canvas. On it he will paint his multi coloured supremacy. Announce God�s name.

Prayer
Lord, make me see you as my all in all, help me to get the right perspective to every life situation in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



			














JANUARY 14				                    THE STONE OF PASSION														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 17:48-51 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 17:48
								So it was when the philistines arose and came and drew near to meet David that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine	.

David sees what others don�t and refuses to see what others do. All eyes, except David�s, fall on the brutal hate-breathing giant. The people know his taunts, demands, and size. They have majored in Goliath. But David majors in God. He sees the giant, mind you, he just sees God more so. And because he does, he hurries and run toward the army to meet the philistine. Not away from, but toward his giant. When was the last time you did the same? How long since you ran toward your challenge? We tend to retreat, duck behind a desk of work or crawl into a night club. For a moment, a day, or a year, we feel safe, insulated, but then the work runs out, the liquor wears off, and we wear Goliath again. Booming bombastic.
What good has problem pondering gotten you? You�ve started so long. You can number the hairs of Goliath chest. Has it helped? No. visiting hurts won�t heal them. Itemizing problems won�t solve them. Categorizing rejections won�t remove them.
Try a different tack. Push your giant with a God saturated soul. Giant of divorce, you aren�t entering my home! Giant of depression? It may take a lifetime, but you won�t conquer me. Giant of alcohol, child abuse, insecurity you�re going down. Let your ring finger remind you to take up the stone of passion.

Prayer
Lord, break me free from every negative addiction that is taking me away from doing your will Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















JANUARY 15			                  THE STONE OF PERSISTENCE														                  SCRIPTURE READING: 2 SAMUEL 21:15-22 
																																KEY VERSE: 2 SAMUEL 21:22
							These four were born to the giant in Gath, and feel by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 

David didn�t think one rock will do. He knew Goliath had four behemoth relatives. Ishbi-benob was a descendant of the giants; his bronze spearhead weighed more than seven pounds. Saph made the list. Then there was the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of his spear was as thick as a weaver�s beam. These three seem harmless compared to King Kong with six 
Fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet, twenty four fingers and toes. He was another of those descended from Rapha. Why did David quarry a quinted of stones? Could it be because goliath had four relatives? David knew they could be running over the hill to defend their kin. He was ready to empty the chamber if that�s what it took.
Imitate him, never give up. One prayer might not be enough. One apology might not do it. On day or month of resolve might not suffice. You may get knock down a time or two but don�t quit. Keep loading the rocks.
Nothing is beyond God�s ability, whether it�s a problem to solve, a marriage to reconcile, a guilty conscience to cleanse, a sin to forgive, a business to save, a budget to stretch, another mouth to feed, a body to cloth, a job to find, a habit to break. A captive to free, a prodigal to return, an addition to overcome or anything else we could name. 

Prayer
Lord, by the authority of your word, destroy totally the goliath of my life and his weapon of war in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

	


















JANUARY 16						CONFIDENCE IN GOD

																														SCRIPTURE READING DEUTERONOMY 31:1-8 
																																KEY VERSE: PHILIPPIANS 4:13
							I can do all things through him who strengthen me.
	
Most people struggle with having confidence in God. We have replaced our view of God as weak and powerless to change situations. We have lost our confidence in him. We did not see him as the one who parted the red sea, the one who calmed the hungry lions in Daniel�s den, the God who sent down fire to consume Elijah�s watery altar.
Even though we are aware of his great love for us, we find it hard to apply that knowledge during the trials of life.
During those crisis times, doubt starts to creep in. The more passionately we pray, the more we wonder whether God is listening. We start to panic when things don�t improve immediately. But if we ignore those feelings of uncertainty and go with what we know to be true, we can be more confidence in God.
If you catch yourself questioning God�s true character, re assure your faith of his mightiness. When you sense your confidence in the Lord is fading, recall personal experience, being able to relive past victories will help you be more confident in God in the present and accounts in the Bible where he has shown himself strong. Every day of your life you have a choice. You can focus on the obstacles before you, or you can be confident in the truth that God is pouring his strength into you. Don�t limit God. Don�t put God in a corner.

Prayer
Lord, strengthen my confidence in you, wrought great wonders that will silence my enemy in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.




			















JANUARY 17			GOD�S WAY ARE HIGHER THAN OUR WAYS

																														SCRIPTURE READING: 2 KINGS 5:7-14
																																KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 55:8
							The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him, for as the heavens are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

Naaman, a great hero, was used to getting respect, and he was outraged when Elisha treated him like an ordinary person. A proud man, he expected a royal treatment. He was furious when Elisha sends a messenger to him. He assumed Elisha himself would come out, call on the name of the Lord, wave his hand over his leprosy and cure him. How mistaken he was. God had a different plan. Perhaps he wanted to break Naaman�s pride.
Often we don�t understand why certain things are happening or why we need to go through certain experiences. Perhaps, like Naaman, who almost missed the blessing of God�s healing by refusing at first to do as he was commanded, we need discipline or God needs to break our pride. Naaman had to humble himself and obey Elisha�s commands in order to be healed. Obedience to God begins with humility. We must believe that his way is better that our way. We may not always understand his ways of working but we must remember that, God�s ways are best and he can use anything to accomplish his purposes.
Don�t act as if you know what God is thinking and planning, his knowledge and wisdom are far greater than man�s. We are wrong to try to fit God into our mould, to make his plans and purpose confirm to ours. Instead we must strive to fit into his plans. We must embrace the mystery of God. 

Prayer
Lord, make your purpose and will know in my life and lead me the way I should go in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















JANUARY 18	                                GODLINESS WITH CONTENTMENT

								SCRIPTURE READING: 1TIMOTHY 6:1-8
																																KEY VERSE: 1TIMOTHY 6:6
						But godliness with contentment is great gain.
	
Godliness is a lifestyle of a Christian while contentment keeps you in the confinement of godliness. Contentment does not mean you have everything in life rather it is act of being satisfy with whatever you had either little or plenty. Most time we often believe that this lack of contentment is only found among the poor but that is not true. This is common factor found in every of human life style.
It is not enough to be Godly in nature without being contented with what you have. As lack of contentment will lead to greed, lies and coveting the things of the world as did by Gehaz.2 king 5:20-27. Gehaz was cursed because he was not contented and this make him engaged in so many sin like deception, lies, greed etc. another vital thing is that, he lost the Godly life style he had initially and it led him to destruction. If we realize the danger of wanting to acquire riches we would retract and concentrate on heavenly race. Today message is telling us to free our mind from acquiring worldly things and be contented with what we had. For has said he will not leave us and never will he forsake us Hebrew 13:5. Stay inspired and enjoy your day with God. 

Prayer
Lord, break my heart free from every form of greed and ungodly desire in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	














JANUARY 19		        			                               OPEN THE DOOR

																														SCRIPTURE READING: REVELATION 3:19-21
																																KEY VERSE: REVELATION 3:20
							Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

Listen! I stand at the door and knock; if any hear my voice and open the door, I will come into their house and eat with them, and they will eat with me.
These words of Jesus are often used in evangelistic situations so that people might open their hearts to him as Saviour and Lord. However, they were actually addressed to the church at Laodicea; to Christians; to people who professed to have already trusted Jesus as their Saviour and Lord but had lost their initial enthusiasm, becoming �lukewarm�.
Think about that if you consider yourself to be a Christian. Has your faith become lukewarm? Has the door to your relationship with Jesus gradually blown shut in the draft of all your comings and goings? Are you so occupied with doing your own thing that you no longer have time to �eat� with Jesus? Has something happened that you�re blaming God for, and so you�ve slammed the door to him? The invitation to open your life to Jesus is for anyone who hears his voice, is that you? Is he knocking on the door of your life? There�s no need for fear opening your life to him, whether opening it for the very first time, or opening it again so that fellowship can be restored between you and him.
Jesus� words are full of wonderful promises, but to benefit from them we must respond to his voice, acknowledge his knock, and welcome him in. Do you hear him? 

Prayer
Lord, I keep my heart open to every of your words and instructions. Help me to fully obey in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

								SCRIPTURE READING: DANIEL 10:1-13

						I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
	
Many times in our Christian life, we need to be reminded of the need to struggle against self satisfaction especially with achieving our goals and purpose of life. These speak of the effort and dedication we need to put in daily achievement as Christians. Prayer is a means of communicating with God. Communication can be further explained as a means of exchanging words. We are meant to communicate with God instead we choose to talk to God. Push �Pray until Something Happens� is the one that define our communication with God. Daniel did not talk to God as most Christians do today, he pushed. The angel made Daniel understood that his prayer has been answered but the kingdom of partial stop the answer from getting to Daniel Dan 10:13. This shows us that we operate between two kingdom (kingdom of darkness & kingdom of God) Colossians 1:13.
It is very important that we are persistent when dealing with God. 1 Thessalonians 5:17. This describes our commitment to him and shows how we so much depend on him for answers. Not until we push, we would be wasting our time on our kneels. It can only get better when we learn to always push. Don�t give up on what you ask God to do instead push �Pray until Something Happen.

Prayer
Lord, give me the power to wait in prayer till my request is fulfilled in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	
















JANUARY 21		                                            MAKE HAY WHEN SUNSHINE

								SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERB 6:4-11
																																KEY VERSE: PROVERB 6:6
					Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.
	
There is a popular saying that �prepare for the unexpected�. It is important that we prepare for the future as we live our life. We lost so many opportunities because we did not prepare. When preparation met with opportunity we have luck. We are losing the plan of God for our life because we did not plan. The story of ant in our text shows how important it is for us to plan. If animal can understand the principle of life founded on planning, how much more we humans. 
I will liken our present life as day and our eternity as night. The sunshine during the day and we can see clearly while night is meant for rest when we enjoy all we have invested. Our preparation is meant to be done during the day so as to enjoy it by night when we can no longer work. John 9:4. Human get distracted by enjoying during the day when we ought to plan. In circular world, we are meant to invest in our future rather than acquiring things in vogue all in the name of being relevant e.g. Latest automobile, electronics garget, making expensive trips outside the country when we have not invested enough for the future. As a Christian now is the time to work for God as a means of investing in your eternity. Do you have hope of eternity? Accept Jesus as your Lord as personal savior and work for him to enjoy your eternity.

Prayer
Lord, help me to learn the key things of life that are profitable to my life and destiny in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	












JANUARY 22	                                                         USING YOUR TALENT WELL 
	
								SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 12:5-8
																																KEY VERSE: 1TIMOTHY 6:17
							Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.

Everything we have is a gift from God. All good things are gifts from God. 1 Timothy 6:17. God�s gifts are used in his service. The gifts we�ve receive is not for ourselves alone. .
In the parable of the talents, Jesus taught that we must use our gifts wisely. We all have different gifts; each of us has unique talents and abilities.
Jesus made it clear that we will be judged on our response to the needs of others. What matters to God is whether we make good use of what we have been given.
The essence of the Christian life is obeying and worshipping God and helping others. Genesis 12:2. God wants us to build his kingdom for his glory. Ephesians 5:23.
We must be a steward of our talents to honour him and bless others, then we are fulfilling his will.

Prayer
Lord, I devote my gifts to the use of your glory in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	

























JANUARY 23						TIMES AND SEASONS
																														SCRIPTURE READING: ECCLESIASTES 3:1-8 
																																KEY VERSE: ROMANS 8:28
							And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
	
Life is comprised of various seasons. Every matter in life has its time. The timing of our activities is important. Dancing may be appropriate during a time of celebration, but it would not be appropriate for a funeral. Both our actions and the timing of our actions are important to God. These seasons in which certain pursuits are proper and appointed by God. His plan for life involves a variety of experiences and activities. God appoints the times and seasons, the events of our lives, the happy and the sad, the easy and the difficult. On one hand this can bring worry, but on the other hand, it should bring you hope because we know that God is in control. The proper activity at the right time, bringing about God�s purposes, is a beautiful part of God�s overall plan. He has a purpose in what he does even if we have a hard time understanding what that purpose is. 
You must wait with patience for the full revelation of God�s mysteries. All you can see is the middle of God�s work not its end. He has you where he wants you. But also, set aside place in your heart where you trust God. Accept each day as a gift from God; don�t be ignorant of God�s timing. God is sovereign. Our activity in this world is meaningful as we rely on God�s wisdom. Times and seasons is good. It helps you not become grace-potato Christians. Times and seasons helps you learn to adapt to new situations and to grow inside.

Prayer
Lord, help me to wait patiently for the fulfilment of your promises. Let my heart not weary away. Bring your time into my season in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
		













JANUARY 24							SEIZE THE DAY I
																														SCRIPTURE READING: ECCLESIASTES 11:1-10
																																KEY VERSE: ECCLESIASTES 11:1
							Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days..
	
Life involves both risk and opportunity, because life has no guarantees, we must be prepared. Life has opportunities and we must seize them, not merely play it safe. Even the best laid plans don�t always work out, that�s a reality we all have to face every day. Solomon says, �Don�t play it safe take risks�. In other words, you have to live confidently. Just because life is uncertain does not mean we should do nothing.
We need a spirit of trust and adventure facing life�s risks and opportunities with God directed enthusiasm and faith. You can�t hide just because life won�t cooperate. Don�t avoid blessings because of the concerns that come with them. God wants you to step out in faith and take risks. Waiting for perfect conditions will mean inactivity. 
Be courageous to diversify your investments. Since life is so uncertain, spread your financial investments out. �Cast your bread on the waters�, did you noticed the word is plural, in other words, don�t put all your grain in one ship. Put your wheat in several ships, and send it out in a diversified way so that if one of the ships should sink, you�ll not be ruined. Don�t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio. It has been said, �A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for�. The truth is, any kind of investing requires gained. No risk, no reward. So Solomon says, �don�t play it safe take risks�.

Prayer
Lord, help me to invest my time and resources on fertile land in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

																														SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 25:14-27
																															KEY VERSE: ECCLESIASTES 11:4
							He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 

God expectation is that we will invest our money wisely. Perhaps all of your money has been in the bank and you are barely drawing interest. Do not commit all of one�s possessions to a single venture. Look for the best means of investing the money that the Lord has entrusted to you. But don�t fall for any get-rich-quick schemes or multi-level-marketing businesses. Before you know it, you�ve spent all of your money.
Since God alone knows the future, we ought to make our plans, use our brains, study the situation, take all factors into consideration, seek wise counsel, do the best you can, and leave the results to God. Don�t be reckless, that�s the path of certain ruin. While taking times and season, seize your opportunities. You cannot delay your course of action. You must seize the day. Don�t waste your time with God�s affairs. Psalm 24:1. Let God be God, he can concern himself with his responsibilities. When we do that, we will realize all that we have to concern ourselves with. 
Today�s work might be ruined and you might have to do it over again tomorrow. But that�s okay. Today�s work might succeed as well as tomorrows. There is no time better than the present to step out in faith. The perfect opportunity begins now. Don�t put what God has placed in your heart off another day. Adhere to the most intelligent option available to you.

Prayer
Lord, bless the thought of my heart, open my eye to great opportunities in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















JANUARY 26						RUNNING FROM GOD I

																														SCRIPTURE READING: JONAH 1:1-4
																																KEY VERSE: JOHAH 1:3
							But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.

Many people today certainly are trying to run from God but do you think you can run from an omnipresent God. The reason why most people run from God is because of their love for sin. Some people, is because of bitterness towards God, because of a tragic event in their life such as the death of a loved one, and bad experiences. How tragic that so many people are running from a loving and good God that cares about us. The problem with most people is that they judge God based on the present circumstances, failing to realize that we were placed upon this earth to be trusted by God      . 
That of Jonah is primarily a man with plans, and this man�s plan did not include Nineveh. He did what many of us do when we hear something we don�t want to hear, he moved to a place where he could no longer hear it. Even when we sometimes sense God leading us in a life giving direction, we find it hard to pry our fingers from our plans. However, we discover when we ignore him and purse our plans that God�s tracking system has a wider rang than we thought. And it finds us in ways we�d never expect.

Prayer
Lord, capture my will as you capture Jonah; help me to fulfil your bidding in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	
















JANUARY 27						RUNNING FROM GOD II

																														SCRIPTURE READING: JONAH 1: 5-16 
																																KEY VERSE: JONAH 1:12
						And he said unto them, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.

The God you are running from would not let you leave him behind. I wonder how many times you�ve decided to take a nap. Maybe it�s not literal sleep you escaped to, but there are many ways to nap when God is pursuing you. When you don�t like what you are hearing, you simply find a way to lower the volume of his voice or when God is trying to move you in a different direction than you planned. It could be something he wants you to do or something he wants you to stop, a turn he is asking you to take or what he wants you to avoid. But if he�s moving you where you want to go, you are happy to listen to him. It�s when you don�t like where he�s moving you that you suddenly grow deaf. But have you discovered that God holds the button for his volume control, no matter how hard you try to snatch it from his hands. And he will use whatever alarm he needs to wake you up.
In Jonah�s case, it was a great storm. He learned the hard way that God is to be feared more than mankind. God sends him a massage via the air and water. Things get real stormy when we run from God. God is merciful but the trip back might be rougher than you hoped for, best thing to do is not sail away. The longer you�re running away the more time spent in the belly of the fish on the return trip. Running away never gains you anything except a big fish story. 

Prayer
Lord, capture the heart of every one for your will, let the knowledge of you fill the earth in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

		


																																		










JANUARY 28							TURNING TO GOD

																														SCRIPTURE READING: JONAH 2:1-10
																																KEY VERSE: JONAH 2:7
							When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. 

Jonah�s discomfort inside the big fish is a marvellous picture of the life of the Christians on earth. Often we act the same way. When life is going well, we tend to take God for granted, but when we lose hope we cry out to him. This kind of relationship with God can result only in an inconsistent, up and down spiritual life. A consistent daily commitment to God promotes a solid relationship with him. Look to God during both the good and bad times and you will have a stronger spiritual life. 
Obviously, Jonah pictured his predicament in the bell of the fish as though he had been buried alive. He was not in a position to bargain with God. Instead, he simply thanked God for saving his life. It was a prayer of thanksgiving, not a prayer for deliverance. Even from inside the fish, his prayer was heard by God. We can pray anywhere at any time and God will hear. God is Spirit. The spirit is not something bound in a body. He has no limitations and because of that he can be everywhere at once, he can hear all, heeding the prayers of all who call out in the name of Christ, see all and know all. Your sin is never great, your predicament never too difficult for God. Our troubles should cause us to turn and cling tightly to God, not attempt to bargain our way out of pain.

Prayer
Lord, expose every form of disobedience in my life, help me to please you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.





















JANUARY 29		                                         THE NEED FOR FORGIVENESS
	
																			SCRIPTURE READING: 2 CORINTHIANS 2:1-11
																																KEY VERSE: 2 CORINTHIANS 2:10
						To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.
	
Forgiveness simply means you have made peace with the pain, and you are ready to let go. This is an act of making things right without passing any judgment. We did not do it for others; it is what we do for ourselves. Unforgiveness stand between you and God because we are all sinners and through grace God has forgiven us and see us as righteous. If God can forgive us all the awful things we have done, we can forgive others. Matthew 6:14-15.
Forgiveness is good for you. When you forgive, it will stop you from holding bitterness and thinking badly about others. It is mainly for your benefit not for the benefit of the person you are forgiving. Choosing not to forgive get you stuck in your past and prevent you from moving forward. When you fail to forgive, it is sinful and it seems to stand in the way of your physical wellness. When you forgive, it leads to purification of the spirit. I John 1:9. Jesus tells us how he suffered and died so that we could be forgiveness. Matthew 26:28. If we don�t forgive, we can�t reign with him. Unforgiveness is a sin and no sinner will inherit the kingdom of God.

Prayer
Lord, give me the heart to forgive everyone that offends me. Let your joy watch away every pain in my heart in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.





















JANUARY 30			    THE HEALING OF THE OPEN WOUND														                  SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 32:3-12; 33:1-9 
																																KEY VERSE: GENESIS 33:4
							But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
	
The last time Jacob had seen Esau, his brother was ready to kill him for stealing the family blessings. Esau was so angry he had vowed to kill Jacob as soon as their father, Isaac died. Fearing their reunion, Jacob sent a messenger ahead with gifts. How would you feel knowing you were about to meet the person you cheated out of his most precious possession? Jacob had taken Esau�s birthright and his blessings. Now he was about to meet his brother for the first time in 20 years, and he was frantic with fear.
It is refreshing to see Esau�s change of heart when the two brothers meet again. The bitterness over losing his birthright and blessings seems gone. Instead Esau was content with what he had. Jacob even exclaimed how great it was to see his brother obviously pleased with him
Esau greeted his brother, Jacob with a great hug. Imagine how difficult this must have been for a man who once had actually plotted his brother�s death. But time away from each other allowed the bitter wounds to heal. With the passing of time, each brother was able to see that their relationship was more important than their real estate.
Life can bring us some bad situations. We can feel cheated as Esau did, but we don�t have to remain bitter. We can remove bitterness from our lives by honestly expressing our feelings to God, forgiving those who have wronged us, and being content with what we have.

Prayer
Lord, every scare of bitterness wash with your word, let me enjoy through happiness in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
		















JANUARY 31			                                THE DRIVER�S SEAT														                  SCRIPTURE READING: GALATIANS 2:20 
																																KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 30:12
						Your ears shall hear a word behind you saying, �This is the way, walk in it�, whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.

Paul did not just change the direction and purpose of his life style, he surrender it totally to Jesus in relinquishing his driver�s seat.
We are all been there at various time in varying degrees. When life get to a point when you don�t know what to do. You are powerless, confused, at the end of your rope, your savings, your patience, your sanity, your understanding, your insurance, your knowledge and it�s weighing you down.
Though we are creatures of habit and letting go, really letting go is hard to do. It�s breaking up with our problem. And we are often very attached to our problems. And we are certainly attached to solving, meddling with and manoeuvring their outcome which nine times out of ten we have already failed in our needs. Handling it over is just that the solution is not up to us. And as anyone who has done this successfully can tell you, the solution is often far from what we envisioned.
Jesus is not meant to be the co-driver of your life when you need him every now and then. He should always be in the driver�s seat of your life all the time. God knows the best way we should go in our lives. He knows more than just the way. He also knows how to get there without waste of time and efforts in errors if we do it ourselves. God want total surrender of the self, submits to the will of God and giving up the control of life. Without the presence and power in our life we will be hopeless slaves over the evil power of Satan.

Prayer
Lord, I yield myself to complete obedience to your words, make your ways straight to me in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	


	













FEBRUARY 1 								THE CHOICE

																														SCRIPTURE READING: DEUTERONOMY 30:11-20
																																KEY VERSE: DEUTERONOMY 30:19-20
							I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you   life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live.

Choices set in motion a series of events which shape your life and the lives of your children and grand children after you. No matter what our choices are today, they are ultimately creating your future. All choices have consequences. We are therefore responsible for our choices. God desires that you choose life, no matter what has happened in your past, no matter how often you have chosen death in the past, no matter how often you have rejected life in your former days; choose life by choosing the Lord.
Since choices often result in eternally significant consequences, how do we make a good choice? We must choose in line with God�s principles. It�s possible to gain the whole world and lose your soul. There is much more in life than the outward and material. We must base our choices on God�s word. According to God�s word we choose life by loving the Lord. We choose life by walking in his ways. Choosing life doesn�t sound too difficult, but it does pose a very real problem. We have confused our wishes with his will. What many people believe are the ways of the Lord are nothing more than their best thinking. They have confused their wills with his will. We choose death when we dismiss God�s will for our life, when we desire nothing more than getting what we want, when we want it, regardless of what God wants for our life. Allow God to direct you and lead you through your every decision. God desires for you to choose life this morning and every morning from here on out.

Prayer
Lord, I come to you, you who alone has the word of life, fill me with your life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
							















FEBRUARY 2		        		                            LIVE BY THE WORD														                  SCRIPTURE READING: LUKE 4:1-4, PSALM 119:65 
																																KEY VERSE: JOB 23:2
							I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.

King David was a man who basically lived by grace. Consequently, he trusted in the word of God, lived accordingly to God�s word. He did not only found direction, he found resources there as well.
The spirit of God uses the word of God to make us like the son of God. To become like Jesus, we must fill our lives with his word. The Bible says, through the word we are put together and shaped up for the tasks God has for us. 2 Timothy 3:17. God�s word is unlike any other word, it is alive. Jesus said �the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. John 6:63. When God speaks things change. Everything around you, all of creation, exists because God said it. He spokes it all into existence.
God�s word generates life, create faith, produce change, frightens the devil, causes miracles, heals hurts, builds character, transform circumstances, imparts joy, overcome adversity, defeats temptation, infuses hope, releases power, cleanses our minds, bring things into being, and guarantees our future forever. We cannot live without the word of God. Never take it for granted. You should consider it as essential to your life as food. God�s word is the spiritual nourishment you must have to fulfil your purpose. It is something more important to our survival than food, shelter, air, water, and gravity. Read it, talk about it, live by it.

Prayer
Lord, let your word take deep root in my life, let it blossom with fruit in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















FEBRUARY 3		          		                            A LIVING SACRIFICE														                  SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 12:1-2 
																																KEY VERSE: ROMANS 6:19
							I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness.

When you hear the word �Sacrifice�, what comes to your mind? Not exactly words to warm our hearts, are they? At least, not our human hearts, which in their own are not prone to want to sacrifice anything. When we think of our life that is full of activities, schedules and commitments, we wonder how we are supposed to do all this and become a living sacrifice.
A dictionary definition of sacrifice says the surrender or destruction of something prized or desirable for the sake of something considered as having a higher claim. This definition comes close to what Paul had in mind. A living sacrifice could require surrender of something we all prize, our bodies, for something that has a higher purpose, worshipping the God of all creation, who has given us this life to begin with.
The Christian life begins with the sacrifice Christ made for our sins. Then Christian walk begins with our presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice unto God. Not only is the presentation of our bodies the subject of Paul�s request, it is the pattern of our behaviours as well. The new creation in Christ is to live with the understanding that old things are passed away, behold all things are become new. We are therefore not to have our lives governed by the thought pattern and dictates of this evil world system.

Prayer
Lord, I yield myself in obedience to Holiness, purify me in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















FEBRUARY 4  					             GIVING GOD OUR BEST

																														SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 12:1- 2
																																	KEY VERSE: ROMANS 12:1
							I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

As we consider giving ourselves to God as living sacrifice, have you considered what it is to be because of God�s great mercy? It is a two-way view, you see the mercy of God as expressed in the giving of his Son for you, and you are seen by God through this same mercy demonstrated in sending his Son to die for your sin, and for the sin of the world. What an awesome view-both ways! In view of such mercy, we are called to offer ourselves as living sacrifice as a spiritual act of worship.
We are not meant to feel guilty if we can�t give what somebody else is giving, or if we can�t do what somebody else is doing. We are not to compare ourselves to others or to be in competition with each other. Each day, we are simply to give to God the best of ourselves that we can. This ability may change from day to day, but doesn�t expect us to give what we haven�t got. Giving God all that we are, all that we have, all that we ever hope to be � we joyfully offer him our best. We do not adhere to the saying �save the best until last�, but we give him our best, first.
Whatever condition you are in this day, whatever circumstances surround you, offer it all to God, along with your heart. Make it an act of worship.

Prayer
Lord, I reverence you in my life, I leave my life to glorify you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















FEBRUARY 5                                                                   SEEK THE GOOD OF OTHERS

																														SCRIPTURE READING: 1 CORINTHIANS 10:23-33 
																																KEY VERSE: 1 CORINTHIANS 10:24
							Let no man seek his own; but every man another�s wealth

�All things are lawful� was a slogan of a strong Corinthians who wanted to exercise their liberty. Paul agreed in nonessential areas all things are lawful. �Seek the good of your neighbour� Although we have liberty in Christ to exercise liberty in nonessential areas but our love for other will cause us to deny our lawful liberties. This love will seek the spiritual good, profit, and edification of our brothers, instead of insisting on what we feel is good for ourselves. We must not throw any obstacle in the way of our brothers weak in Christ.
However, the passage is about Paul talking on dealing with situation of eating at idols temple, which is forbidding because it causes believer to engage in idolatry. A believer is free to eat from the marketplace. Just don�t ask where it comes from. Why is he free? Because everything on the earth is the Lord�s. Psalm 24:1. Meanwhile for the good, profit and edification of weaker believer, give up your right in that situation. Paul encourages limiting our liberty so that we don�t allow it to be judged by the weaker brother conscience. If we seek the good of others we must checkmate things to be done if they will glorify God, if it will profit others, if it will promote salvation of the lost in it etc. This will also allow us to manage the lawful liberties we had as a believer.

Prayer
Lord, strengthen the weak among us and open their eyes to the expending truth of your word in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.




















FEBRUARY 6  						BUILDING A GOOD NAME

																														SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERB 22:1-5 
																																KEY VERSE: PROVERB 22:1
							A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favor than silver and gold.

What�s in a name? I�m just talking about your reputation, although your reputation is a part of your name. And I�m not just talking about your personal brand, although again, that�s part of it. Your name communicates the very essence of who you are. It�s your character, it�s your history. It�s your value and one day it will be your legacy. All of these, and far more, are wrapped up in your name.
A good name is like a leadership card; before you even open your mouth your name communicates that your voice is one to be listened to and respected. And that�s why it is so important to build and nurture a strong name. To build a good name you have to put the following in action. Keep your word, extend grace, be humble, respect others, work hard, honor leaders, offer assistance, be generous, be optimistic, show compassion. The point is that your name will have a lot more to do with who you are than with what you accomplish.

																																KEY VERSE: 2 CHRONICLES 34:2
							And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father David, he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

At ages eight, Josiah became king because his evil father was so awful that his own servants killed him. Fortunately for Josiah he had an ancestor who had set a much better example who is mentioned as part of Josiah�s family tree. There are times along the journey when you come to a cross road and have the chance to change direction. Josiah had the opportunity to make a choice that would certainly define his destiny. He could choose to follow the example of his father and grandfather, or he could find another leader after which to model his life. Josiah was careful about the example he followed and the influence he allowed into his life. He recognized that that some of the people around him did not provide the best influence.

FEBRUARY 8       				                                      HONOUR  
	
																														SCRIPTURE READING: 1 PETER 2:17
																																				KEY VERSE: PROVERBS 8:1 
						Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put forth her voice?

Honour means to places high respect or great esteem on something or someone. 
As Christians we need to understand the act of honour so we can live our lives in ways that others will emulate and honour us too. Honour is not something we must learn how or negotiate how to express, Roman 12:10 stated �Be�kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honour giving preference to one another�
As we go from places to places and from people to people we need to learn what honour means to them so we don�t go amiss on critical issue. Practice honour before you get to where it will cost you to learn.
When you show honour the right way, it will attract you to people that matters. Great people like to be honoured and respected, in dealing with them you ought to show then the honour they deserve, elderly ones, your parent, your pastor, your boss, your husband, your wife, your children etc. you must learn how to honour people and things around you.
In life, there are certain things or opportunities that honour will give to you that your effort can�t give to you. Anywhere you go never violate the law of honour; it will take you a long way.

Prayer
Lord ,help me not to be full of myself in your sight and in the sight of men in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

							Respect everyone, and love your Christian brothers and sisters. Fear God, and 
respect the king.
	
Today we shall look at some people in our life that we ought to honour;
Firstly, honour God .1 Timothy 1:17��Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.� The place of honouring God cannot be over emphases. He deserves all honour without him we won�t be and without us he will continue to be God. He is the Almighty creator of all, the source and creator of our mankind. We are honour God with our heart, body and substance. Revelation 13: 1
Honour our earthly parent. Never dishonour your parent irrespective of their human error, establish in your heart there place of honour and never negotiate it. Take your stand to honour them. Ephesians 6:2.  This is the first commandment with a promise; the reward of honouring them is yours, so don�t loss your reward.
Honour your spiritual leader. The bible speaks of this group as worthy of double honour 1 Timothy 5:17 �Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in preaching and teaching�
Honour those in position of authority. The bible speaks of submitting to the governing authority because they have been establish by God Romans 13: 2 �Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation�. This is wisdom for believers. 

Prayer 
Lord, I apply to heart honour you and those you have placed in my life to lead and direct my path in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

							Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.

Today let�s look at things that deserve our outright honour for accurate living:
Honour the presence of God: the presence of God is not to be taken like any other place, whenever you come before his presence let it be symbolic in your heart that God deserves all the honour, do everything to reverence His presence, by such doing you will enjoy the fullness of God�s outpouring.
Honour your marriage: Hebrews 13:4 �marriage is honourable in all.� in all your marriage should not be dishonoured. Most people don�t see marriage beyond just living with someone they love, as such they look down, talk down and in their heart they reduce the institution of  marriage and this has given the devil access into most marriages.  
Honour your work: never give in to laziness; this is an act of dishonour to work. Ecclesiastes 9: 10��Whatever your hand finds to do, do�it�with your might�� God has promised to bless the work of our hands, put those hands to honourable work.
Honour God word. God words to you are live and live to you, treat them with honour don�t make mockery of them don�t ignore them watch and water them till the fulfilment though it tarries it will not fail.
Honour the elderly one among you. Leviticus 19:32 �You shall stand up before the gray head and honour the face of an old man, and you shall�fear your God: I am the�Lord.

FEBRUARY 11		                                   COMMUNAL RELATIONSHIP														                  SCRIPTURE READING: ACT 9:36-42
																																KEY VERSE: ACT 9:36
							Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tahitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
											
Communal relationship talks about the way we build our relationship in Christian community. It is absolute blessing and a challenge to open up to your community.
The picture of a Christian community the bible paint is not so different from our relationship on earth as far as we are joined through Christ. Romans 12:4-5.
In reality, it can be difficult to dig into local Christian communities especially when you feel overwhelmed and isolated by the challenges of life, community can be a hard place to fit into a relationship wise but as you consider yourself in relation to community, take a minute and think of the fears or the shame that holds you back from being vulnerable with those around you. But the best way to intertwine communal relationship with thankfulness is hospitality. Romans 12:13. �Our actions today, a legacy tomorrow. Are we making a difference�

Prayer
Lord, help me to build a good relationship and make positive impact around me and beyond, in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

























FEBRUARY 12						TWO WRONGS, NO RIGHT

																														SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 27:1-8
																																KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 27:5
							And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hangs himself. 

Story of a high profile civil servant that claimed to have compassion for the less privilege and his ready to assist at all cost. However, engage in many fraudulent acts by looting the national treasury to fulfill his mission. An eternal auditor was hired to look into the financial records and discovered where and who defrauded the organization. In the process of making the fraudulent act remain a secret, the external auditor was assassinated just to make sure it was not reveal. Judas Iscariot sold Jesus for pieces of silver and still goes ahead to hung himself. Criminal and suicide are sin before God and anybody that involve in such act is doomed for hell.
It is better to seek for repentance like Peter after any wrong than trying to cover sin with sin which leads to multiple wrong. The prodigal son rudely demands for his inheritance from his father and left to unknown country and squander it. He end up as a beggar but he realize one day that he had wrong his father and took a decision to beg for forgiveness. He was received and celebrated by the father. If you have done anything wrong, what you need is repentance and you will be restored. 

Prayer
Lord, Order my step by your word, fill me with your true love that will bring restoration through repentance to my soul in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















FEBRUARY 13							  LONELINESS
																														SCRIPTURE READING: ECCLESIASTES 4:8-12
																																KEY VERSE: ECCLESIASTES 4:10
							For if they fail, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

By God�s design we have an innate need to be loved and belong. Through our relationship with family, friends, co-workers and others. We form our sense of individuality and find our place in life. It is when that need for affection and fellowship goes unfulfilled that we become restless, unhappy and lonely. 
Loneliness is a state of mind, an emotion brought on by feelings of separation from other human beings. The sense of isolation is very deeply felt by those who are lonely. There is no deeper sadness that ever comes over the mind than the idea that we are alone in the world, that we do not have a friend, that no one cares for us, that no one is concerned about anything that might happen to us, that no one would care if we were to die or shed a tear over our grave.
If you are struggling with loneliness, you�re not alone. Everyone experience seasons of isolation for one reason or another. Whatever cause of your loneliness, there is a way out. The cure is always the same, the comforting fellowship of Christ. He is the friend who sticks closer than a brother, who lays down his life for his friends, and who has promised never to leave us or forsake us but to be with us until the end of the age. There is a need to connect with something larger than ourselves in order to fill the vacuum that exists within us. When we accept God�s gift of eternal life through Jesus, we enter into communion with creator of the universe. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you identify actions you can take to overcome loneliness. 
Admit the problems, only after you acknowledge that you are lonely, can you take the steps necessary to escape from your isolation. Consider the causes, evaluate your life and accept what cannot be changed. Be willing to let go of the past and move on. Alter what can be changed. Many of the causes of loneliness can be overcome. Regardless of the reason, you owe it to yourself to take measures that will meet the problem head on.

Prayer
Lord, fill all the emptiness my life and send your word to comfort me, raise angel in form of men to comfort me in time of loneliness in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.   











FEBRUARY 	14						  ALONE BUT NOT ALONE

																																				SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 43:1-4 
																																KEY VERSE:  ISAIAH 43:2
							When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.

Man�s journey to destiny will require him to pass though the water and fire of live. Most time when we are faced with difficulties and suffering rather than trace the source, understand the purpose and make use of the lessons from it, we either go into isolation or try to apportion blame even to God, Why me? God has forgetting me!
God said in his word When we go through the heat and storm of life he will surely accompany us. He is truly around when we think we are all alone in any situation.
As a loving father never abandons his children in times of difficulties, God never does too, he knows how to give a much better companionship and solution to our daily need, we only need to trust in him and walk with him more closely. 
The bible says in John 16:33�have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
There is no situations you are passing that God does not know about, you have to get your confessions right, hold on to his promise and always remember without faith it is impossible to please God.

Prayer
Lord, when I pass through life fire let me see you clearly in the midst of life difficulty in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.




















	FEBRUARY 15						    HOLINESS A MUST

																														SCRIPTURE READING: EPHESIANS 4:17-24
																																KEY VERSE: EPHESIANS 4:24
							And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

To be holy is the opposite of being common or profane. God is holy in that he is utterly different and distinct from his creation. His people must also be distinct, separate from the heathen attitudes and actions which characterized them as unbelievers. I peter 2:9 conveyed this idea of separateness. But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
Holiness is a must because it is obedient to the word of God which commands it. Peter call to obedient is a repetition of a command given long before by God himself to the nation Israel: you shall be Holy, for I am holy. We should be holy because God commands it. We are to be holy to be like God, our Father, who called us to be holy. Never is it assumed that unbelievers can or will strive for holiness. Only his children are able to do so, by his grace and through his spirit.

Prayer
Lord, sanctify and purify my life, make me a vessel for your glory in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.























	FEBRUARY 16			             GLORIFY GOD WITH YOUR BODY

																																KEY VERSE: 1 CORINTHIANS 6:20
							For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God�s.

Our natural body is from dust and temporary, it will return to dust once we are dead. It is certain and that God made stomach for food, but he did not design the body for fornication. Our body is a medium through which we serve God; we are more than natural bodies, we are God temple. Sex is more than physical act as it involve the man and woman coming together and become one. It is God�s means of building a union between the both physically and emotionally. 
Since our body is a member of Christ, we can�t give same body for immorality. I Cor. 6:15. It is a sin when the body that is expected to be kept clean is now used to engage in ungodly act. As we are member of Christ we are also temple of the Holy Spirit. It was God who sent us the Holy Spirit to dwell in us once we become his children, so we no longer belong to ourselves. So many things are precious to us in this world but nothing is as precious as what was paid for our salvation. Our gratitude as an act of appreciation is to glorify God with our bodies.

Prayer
Lord, help me keep myself from every act that will defile me, I lift this temple to you fill it and use it for your glory in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen






















FEBRUARY I7					   		LEARN FROM GOD

																														SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 11:28-29
																																						KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 11:29
				�  Take my yoke and put it on you, and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit; and you will find rest.  

For everyone that comes to Christ and surrender his life, find firstly rest of salvation, liberation from the load of sins and secondly the rest that comes from learning from Christ as He takes us through life�s journey, for as many that hands over the wheel completely to him. As believer we have just one Lord and saviour which is Christ Jesus the son of the living God, he was there at the beginning and see the end from the beginning, that simple means he knows more then we can ever know about our self, about the people around us or situation we can ever find ourselves or even the world we are living in.
Man can be cut in-between any of these four states of knowledge:
When you don�t know that you don�t know.
When you know that you know.
When you know that you don�t know.
When you don�t know that you know.
The first two states is the state of gross ignorance and pride, you need the spirit of humility and a teachable heart.
The last two keeps you seeking to know and learn continuously, and Christ has offer us himself that we learn, from him that is the wisdom of God personified. Psalm 119:9-10 �How can�a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.�With my whole heart I seek you; let me not�wander from your commandments!

Prayer
Lord, pull down every form of pride and ignorance in me, flood my life with your knowledge in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

																														SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 13:10-17
																																KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 13:16	
							But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.�

Most people won�t go far in live because they do not know life requires learning, relearning, and always learning. The different stages of man�s life requires adequate information to be able to prepare and manage situation as they unfold, else one will be a victim of circumstance and even miss out of great opportunity.
God gave you eyes to see, ear to hear and a mind to develop information, put this into positive use, many people have invested time unconsciously in Idleness and laziness when time could be spent on studying, researching or even in sport, all they needed to do was to put in a little effort and they will discover how easy learning a particular skill was for them Proverbs 16:27-29.
One philosophy about live is that �after school you should still go to school�. None of us should graduate from the school of learning.
God has invested a lot in us and expects us to engage those resources positively to turn our life and situation around and beautify the world we are in. God expect us to learn and learn and keep learning even as we move through lives Journey. Train your heart and your mind to be desirous to learning.

Prayer 
Lord, give me a teachable spirit and a heart desirearous for knowledge in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

							Four things are small on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise.
		
It is important to know whom to learn from and be sensitive to learning times. We are to learn from God, anyone who learns from him becomes wise. Proverb 9:10-11. When we learn from God we become something far more than we can ever have been. The scripture went on to say our days shall be multiplied and our year shall be filled with increase, what a glorious opportunity when we learn from God in our quiet time. When we study the word of God it cultures our spirit man in been sensitive to hearing God when he is speaking to us.
We are also to learn from God�s righteous servant that has been placed as our Spiritual Father.  None of use chose our biological parents, so when God gives us spiritual fathers don�t disown him or her and start chasing another. 1 Samuel 3:19-20.
We can as well learning from peoples experiences. It is generally better to learn from other peoples experiences than from oneself, try to draw out wisdom from situation and event around you to equip yourself.

																														SCRIPTURE READING: JEREMIAH 18:1-6
																																KEY VERSE: JEREMIAH 18:2
							Arise and go down to the potter�s house, and there I will announce my words to you.�

There are different times in our lives when we have to learn. When you are baptized with the spirit of learning you will know when wisdom is speaking.
Learn when you are down. Most people are usually depressed when they are down they tend to isolate themselves and just allow time pass without drawing lesson from such experience, most times we say, �only God knows why� when there are obviously lessons that you can learn from the situation.
Learn when going up in life. When you realize you are moving forward in life you must realize you need a good sense of learning. Learn those things that God is using to lift you up to effectively invest in them. Also, when you are going up learn from the people you meet on your way; learn from the course of their failure or stagnation or success.
Learn from your mistake. When you learn from your mistake you have what it takes to bounce back, better look inward, analyze correctly what happened, how it happened, what lead to it and what is needed to bounce back. You must stop and refute the mindset of defeat. Sometimes mistakes help us to purse and get our direction clearly.
Learn when you are angry. Ephesians 4:26 says �Be angry, and do not sin��do not let the sun go down on your wrath� get to know what makes you angry, understands what  your responses are when you are angry, identify your control level when you are angry and what you need to do when else you are cut by anger. The presence of the Holy Spirit in you is stronger than whatever make you angry, so you must master your anger. As you learn to control your anger the lord will help you.

Prayer
Lord, help me to be sensitive to know when wisdom is speaking around me, help me pick up useful information on time in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

																														SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERBS 8:1-12
																																			KEY VERSE: PROVERBS 8:1 
						Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put forth her voice?
	
When you develop the spirit of learning, you will be able to sense it, when wisdom is speaking around you. Life itself is school; learning remains very important for anyone who wants to succeed.
Relevant information for life and destiny are somewhere around you, your sensitivity in identifying them and take appropriate measure is Wisdom, just as the young boy leak the plot to kill Apostle Paul, if he had despised the young boy he would had been killed.
Proverb 8: 1-4 �Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put forth her voice? She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.�Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.�
Go through life as a learner and keep learning because learner will ultimately someday become a leader. What you know is what you can profit from, the degree of mastery you have in it determines the value men will place on you.
Take your days of followership very seriously either under your Pastor, Supervisor, and Tutor or even under your parent, learn well this will help you to lead well. Whatever you want to become you must learn it whether to be rich or poor.

							Wherefore he saith, awake thou that sleepest, and arise from dead, and Christ shall give you light.
	
Awake, you who sleep, Arise from dead, and Christ will give you light.
God tell us to wake up. We all need physical sleep, so there is nothing wrong in sleeping at the proper time. But when it is time to wake up, it can be disastrous not to do. We are warned about sleeping too much in proverb. �Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes and you will be satisfied with bread� Proverb20:13. It is not wrong to sleep, but it is wrong to love sleep. Sleep is not an end in itself, but it is a means to an end.
He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame �Proverb 10:5. There are occasion when no extra time may be taken for sleep. When the grain is ripe and the weather is favorable, the harvest must be brought in without delay, or a whole summer�s work can be lost to decay. We are also warned not to sleep spiritually and if we are asleep spiritually, we are told to wake up. The bible is our spiritual alarm clock. Most of the wake-up calls in scripture are address to believer.

Prayer
Lord, awaken every one that slumber amidst us, open their eyes to the arm slumber in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

















FEBRUARY 23							NEVER GIVE UP

																														SCRIPTURE READING: 1 KINGS 18:41-46

							And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man�s hand. And he said, go up, say unto Ahab, prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.

Most time we feel the best way to get out of a situation is just to give up. To give up in any challenges we find ourselves is a sign of failure. Despite the fall of man in the Garden of Eden, God keep putting His best in to action to make sure man does not spend his eternity in hell. Several prophets were sent to put man back on the right track by telling man the mind of God, but the solution was not good enough. However, God was forced to make a tough decision by sending Jesus to die for our sin. 
Elijah was consistence in his prayer for rain to fall and he fails to be discouraged when there was no sign of rain. The confidence he has in God gives him the assurance that God will answer him. He prayed till God answer him and there was rain. He refuses to give up on the present situation and God proof himself. What are you going through that seems not to have a solution? Pray harder, have faith in God and He will answer you. Never give up on Him because he never gives up on you.

Prayer
Lord, help me to persist in the place of pray, reveal your great works in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.






















FEBRUARY 24					CATCH THE MOVING TRAIN                                                     
			
																			SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 25:10-13
																																KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 25:10
							And when they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
		
As we all know that train is a means of transportation. It is used to convey people, animals and load from one location to another. However, when the train starts moving, the door is always shut and it doesn�t stop till it gets to its destination. Once you miss it and it�s gone, there is no way to catch up with it. We need to catch up with the train while it is still available.
In the Old Testament, God told Noah to build an ark as a means of recue from the destruction ahead through flood Gen 6:1-22. Many took the privilege for granted and when the flood came, it was too late for them to catch up with the ark because the door of the ark has been shut.
Jesus is the moving train and the destination is heaven. This is the home of God almighty and no fornicator, thief, lair and ungodly will have a place there. Remember that once you are on board, you don�t have to let the love of the world and the prides of life cause you to be left behind. Catch the moving train by giving your life to Christ. Don�t allow anything in this world to make you miss the train.

Prayer
Lord being every lost soul to your kingdom let your light shine on everyone in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















FEBRUARY 25						LIFE IS MEANINGLESS
																														SCRIPTURE READING: ECCLESIASTES 1:1-11
																																KEY VERSE: ECCLESIASTES: 1:2
							Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

One person in the Bible we had everything, wisdom, power, riches, honour reputation, and God�s favour, yet expressed ultimate emptiness of all that this world has to offer. Not to destroy our confidence in our own efforts, abilities and righteousness but to direct them to commitment to God as the only reason for living. If we try to find meaning in our accomplishments rather than in God, we will never be satisfied and everything we pursue will become wearisome. All human accomplishment will one day disappear, and we must keep this in mind in order to live wisely. If we don�t, we will become either proud or self-sufficient when we succeed or solely disappointed when we fail. Only the pursuit of life anchor by God brings real satisfaction. Life without God is long and fruitless search for enjoyment, meaning and fulfilment.
True happiest is not in our power to accumulate or attain because we always want more than we can have, we suffer the frustration of always wanting something different regardless of what our eyes see and our ears hear, we want more. Yet the more we try to get, the more we realize how little we really have.
No pleasure or happiness is possible without God. Without him, satisfaction is a lost search. This is life under the sun; a life without God is a life without purpose. We were created for relationship with him and if that does not exist, then life has no meaning.

Prayer 
Lord, make my life meaningful, give me the grace fulfil your purpose for my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















FEBRUARY 26                      WAYS JESUS TEACHES US TO ACT NOT OVERRACT                                                           
	
								SCRIPTURE READING: NUMBERS 20:7-13
																																KEY VERSE: EPHESIANS 4:26
									Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath

It is important that we learn about managing our emotions rather than allowing our emotions to manage us. Our emotion can be a strength to us if we are able to continuously put it under control otherwise it can be a fool in the hand of the devil to constantly attack us so as to make us miss it in life and destiny. 
Moses and Aaron did not enter the promise land because they overacted and thereby defile God before the children of Israel. When we get angry,  it is important to be able to stop, identify that we are angry, examine our hearts to determine why we are angry and then proceed in a biblical manner Ephesians 4:26. Human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires James 1:20. The bible tells us we are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit not by our emotions.
Sharing our feelings with others is also helpful in managing our emotions, the Christian life is not meant to be lived alone. God has given us the gift of others believers who can share our burdens and whose burdens we share. Galatians 6:1-10.

Prayer
Lord, help me not to give in to sin in time of angry, let your spirit govern my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen .























FEBRUARY 27								MODERATION
	
																														SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERBS 6:9-11 
																																	KEY VERSE: PHILIPPIANS 4:5
							Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

Moderation avoids extremes, exercise restraint, and is related to self-control. Much of western culture is saturated with excess but the bible teaches us that excess does not work so well and it helps us understand how and why we should live with moderation. Even good things can become a stumbling block to us, if used without moderation. Chocolate is good but too much is unhealthy. Sleep is necessary, but bible say too much sleep lead to poverty Proverbs 6:9-11. One of the most common topics in respect to moderation is that of drinking alcohol. Ephesians 5:18. And be not drunk with wine, where in is excess, but be fill with the spirit.
Practicing moderation is good discipline. In fact, self control is one of the qualities that the Holy Spirit produces in the life of a believer Galatians 5:22-23. When we lack self-control in a certain area of our life, it can indicate that we are not allowing God fully in that area. The only thing in which we don�t need moderation is God Himself. We are to love God without limit. We can never have too much of God, and we can never love Him too much. The more we allow Holy Spirit to invade our life, the easier it becomes to live in moderation in all other things.
	
Prayer
Lord, help me to live my life to please you, fill my life with your goodness in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















FEBRUARY 28  							GO WITH THE GUIDE

																														SCRIPTURE READING: PSALM 37:23-25
																																	KEY VERSE:  PSALM 32:8
										I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye

Guide is a set of instructions that gives directive or details of how things operate. We need to understand that it is very important that we have a guide. If you buy a garget, it is the guide that will tell you how to operate and maintain such garget. However, you might not be able to operate a garget or you can under use and abuse it if you don�t make use of the guide. Most time you tend to use experience or idea, instead of using the guide. You give wrong command because you want to access some secured area. Every manufacturer always includes a guide in everything they produce.
God that creates us has given us a guide. The word of God bible is our guide. How often do you make use of the guide? It�s important you make use of the guide daily. Read and study it to know Gods plan for your life each day so as to avert problem and hardship. Your experience and idea cannot help; it will only lead to failure, complication or destruction. Depend on God who created you and he will teach and guide you in every area of your life.

Prayer 
Lord, lead me in the way I should go, send your word to guild every of my decision in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















	
MARCH 1		                                          THE POWERFUL PRESENCE OF GOD	                                                            
							SCRIPTURE READING: ACTS 9:1-9
																															KEY VERSE: ACTS 9:4
									And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutes thou me?
	
The presence of God satisfies our deepest spiritual longings. God is holy, he is all powerful. We cannot take his presence for granted. It is only through the cross and resurrection of Jesus that a way into his presence and the gift of the Holy Spirit living within you is made possible 
Sometimes, God breaks into a life in a spectacular manner as in the case of Apostle Paul. The presence of God changes our human understanding of who we are and what will become of us in life.
It reveals our secrets sin, the dark places in our hearts, lead us to repentance and nature us till restoration is made manifest. The longer we spend in his presence, the more the light of God shines in us. It changes our lives and the lives of others around us. It gives power to both our words and action. He makes possible signs and miracles. 
When you carry God where ever you go, he goes wherever you go. Make sure you have the assurance of God presence with you. Exodus 33:14 says �my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest� 

Prayer
Lord, let your powerful presence go with me as I proceed in this new month in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	


	










MARCH 2								OBEY THE LORD
	
																													SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 6:13-22
																															KEY VERSE: GENESIS 6:22
					Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
	
It is clear that when there is no instruction, there is nothing to obey. This establishes the popular saying that where there is no law, there is no sin. Most time you fail to understand the necessity of obedience and you choose to do things the way you feel. It is important to obey the Lord because there is a purpose for the laid down instruction. Those instructions are to guide, protect and direct your way of life according to God�s plan.
Noah was approached by God to build an ark. Naturally, there is no history of rain in the land but Noah obeyed the Lord. He understood the consequence of disobedience. Therefore he followed God instruction to the letter. The obedience is what spares him and his family from the destruction of the flood. Likewise, Lot was told to leave Sodom and Gomorrah because God want to destroy the city. Lot obeyed the Lord to letter while his wife did not obey to the letter and she turned pillar of salt. God given instruction is not to deprive you of any opportunity but to better your situation. You might think he does not understand because you are human but he did. Obedience has no substitute.
Obey the Lord and you will be safe and fulfill. 

Prayer
Lord, give me the heart of obedience to steadfastly follow your leading in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	













MARCH 3			           	     THE FOOLISHNESS OF YOUR WISDOM														                 SCRIPTURE READING: 1 CORINTHIANS 3:18-23 
																															KEY VERSE: JAMES 1:5	
								If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God who gives to all liberally and without reproach and it will be given to him.

Paul was not telling the Corinthians believers to neglect the pursuit of knowledge. He was warning them that if worldly wisdom holds them back from God, it is not wisdom at all. God�s way of thinking is far more valuable, even though it may seem foolish to the world.
Ever since Satan injected to Eve the desire of independent from God, we all were born with that nature. I don�t need God. This is the root of all problems to live life without the interface of God. We want to do things our way. We are so much about �my way� than �good way� or �good results� The �I, me, mine and myself� are very important to our ego, infact, the only thing we know about life. We want to preserve our pride. It is pride that drives men to make many mistakes and suffer terrible consequences. We don�t want others to tell us what to do with our life or help us to make better choice. I don�t need your help; I know what I am doing. Pride has destroyed many lives, shattered marriages and humbles many otherwise good and faithful Christians. The self righteousness of human wisdom and work is the first step we all need to work on. So we can relinquish our desire to take control of our life. Let God takes over, makes decisions, gives values and purposes, direct and purse goals that are not ours but God�s. Have faith in Christ to direct your life, lead your life. Then we will be totally at peace with God and with our inner being. We trust God in Christ to know us, meet our needs and give us joy and peace.  

Prayer
Lord, I acknowledge that of my own I can do nothing, give me the wisdom to profit on earth in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















MARCH 4				          			FAITH WITHOUT WORK

																													SCRIPTURE READING: JAMES 2: 14-26 
																															KEY VERSE: JAMES 2: 17
							Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

Faith is the substance of things hope for, evidence of things not seen. For every manifestation as a Christian, our faith must meet with our works. It is our works that allow our faith to materialize. Faith without work is dead because it reveals the heart that has not been transform by God. When we have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, our lives will demonstrate the new life. Our work will be characterized by obedience to God. Unseen faith will become seen by the production of the fruit of the spirit in our lives. Galatians 5:22.
Faith without work is dead because it comes from a heart that has not regenerated by God. Empty professions of faith have no power to change lives.
Abraham was justified by work when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar. His faith wrought with his work, and by his works was his faith made perfect. 

Prayer
Lord, help me to take the necessary action needed for the execution of your wonders, I cooperate with every of your workings on earth in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	















MARCH 5			           	                                                             BE STILL														                 SCRIPTURE READING: MARK 4:36-41 
																															KEY VERSE: PSALM 46:10
									Be still, and know that I am God, I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.

The word �Still� comes from a Hebrew word meaning to �let go� or �release�. The meaning would be best understood to say �cause� yourself to become restrained or let go. In other words, we need to come to a place where we are willing to submit ourselves to God and acknowledging that he is in sovereign control. How does acknowledging God impact us? We know that he is all knowing, present everywhere, all powerful, holy, sovereign, faithful, infinite, and good. Acknowledging God implies that we can trust him and surrender to his plan because we understand who he is. When we are still and surrendered to God, we find peace even when earth gives way and the mountains fall. When we realize that we are truly incapable of controlling life, we can surrender our will to God�s will it may be a matter of finally saying we trust him. This will open the door so that we may experience the fullness of all God wants and has for us. After all, he is our creator and has a perfect plan for us when we let him orchestrates it. Run to him, lay down your weapons and fall into his arms. Be still and know that he is God.

Prayer
Lord, give me the courage to rest peacefully on you during the stormy period of my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
		





















MARCH 6					   		       TAKE MY YOKE

																													SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 11:28-29
																																		KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 11:29
				�Take my yoke and put it on you, and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit; and you will find rest.  

Jesus called to himself all those who are tired of carrying heavy loads and promised to give them rest, not forcing them to come take what he has for them, but opening up the will to choose.
His offer is open to anyone who realizes the load and burden on him is heavy. It is so sadden that most of us come to the lord with our load, burden and pain and expect Christ to take it off immediately without taken up our responsibilities. It is your responsibility to take up the Lords yoke and put it on you and learn from the master himself before the expected end can be realized and you will find rest. Christ didn�t say come to me and find rest for your soul, he said that he would come down to do for you what you ought to do for yourself. You have a role to play in it and that is a level of responsibility and open declaration, gentleness and humility of spirit.
The message bible put it�s this way, I�ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me, watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. Keep Company with me and you�ll learn to live freely and lightly. I encourage you to walk with Christ and work with Christ. Let Christ be all that matters in lives daily walk and you will experience a grace filled live.

Prayer
Lord, I trade my burdens, gains and worries for your will and calling in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















MARCH 7					CONSOLATION THROUGH PRAYER

																													SCRIPTURE READING: 2 CORINTHIANS 1:3-11 
																															KEY VERSE: 2 CORINTHIANS 1:7
							And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the suffering, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
	
Comfort during times of adversity strengthen the soul and fortifies it to carry on. The right words or gestures at the right time help alleviate the suffering one may feel. But there is one way to soothe the hurt one may be experiencing: prayer. Other people reaching beyond themselves, to lift another up before the Lord make a different in their fight. When we have been comforted in hard times, we are to share the comfort with others who are going through similar hard times. The word consolation is refers to the solace or comfort we receive as we go through trials.
There are various consolation received through prayer when we are faced with different challenges. This gives freedom from burden cause by those challenges we are going through. We often received deliverance from death that may be the outcome of those problems we had. 2 Corintians1:9-10. Whenever God answers prayer, there will be rejoicing and thanksgiving from His people. 

Prayer
Lord, send your word to me, help me to pray according to your will for timely result in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















MARCH 8							PRAYER THE MASTER KEY

																													SCRIPTURE READING: I KINGS 17: 17-24 
																																KEY VERSE: I KINGS 17: 22
							And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.

Prayer is a livewire of an unlimited breakthrough. The desire to be successful is in people and they work around it to make a reality but only few leverage on fervent prayer instead of depending on their ability only. The lord has promise a world of unlimited breakthrough if we hold unto Him. John 16:33. He is ready to take us through every step but we must ask for help in prayer with full expectation. 
We can see that the widow that was taking care of the prophet Elijah during drought lost her son and she told the prophet. Elijah prayed and God restore the child back to life. A fervent prayer is a sign of our faith in God and His ability to break through any limitations of life. It positions us above the devil, and gave us access to the redemptive blessing purchase for us by Christ with His blood. Whatever the challenges before you now, prayer is the master key to break through it. 

Prayer
Lord, I appreciate you because you hear me whenever I call, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of heart be continually acceptable in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.



















MARCH 9 		 WAITING ON GOD�S TIME AND NOT LOOSE YOUR MIND											
																													SCRIPTURE READING: PSALM 130: 5-6 
																																KEY VERSE: MICAH7:7
								Therefore I will look unto the Lord: I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

The times we prayed to the Lord with all our heart but felt no answers to the prayer and had to wait for an amount of time. The Lord was fighting for us in those whole times, fighting for us in places we could never imagine, things took shape and worked out in his timing and his will.
He doesn�t take unusual talent; it simply takes faith in God and a willingness to wait on him.   Believe that the God who saved you hear your cries, watch with expectancy, but be prepare for unexpected answers. Put your hope in his word trust in the Lord, not in your own understanding. Resist fretting, retain from anger be still and choose patient. Be strong and take courage. See it as an opportunity to see God�s goodness. 
Waiting period can be tough as it will seem as if there is no way out and we will think time is longer than normal but it is when we are out of options that we are most ready for God�s surprises. 
God is never late he make everything beautiful in its time and God�s timing is always perfect giving you lasting success and peace. Ecclesiastes 3:11. 

Prayer
Lord, help me understand the operation of your work in my life, help me stay focus on you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

















MARCH 10						                 HE LISTENS

																													SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 65:24
																															KEY VERSE: JEREMIAH 33:3
							Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
		
So many times when you are going through a rough time and things are not going as planned. Often you felt neglected because you have prayed and there is no sign of positive change. Your marriage might be going through a tough time from family or spouse, your business might be facing serious financial challenges, you might be feeling uncomfortable or sick health wise, and you might be fighting one spiritual battle or the other. You are worried and discourage of the whole situation.
The text shows that our heavenly father cares and loves us. He listens even before you speak, he knows and sees your heart and he is ready to answer our prayer and complains. You don�t need to be discouraged when there is delay. He gave us the assurance that he listen and he encourage us to call on him. Jeremiah 33:3.
As a father, he has a special interest in listening to us and he will want you to call on him.

Prayer
Lord, open my eyes to things that am yet to know about my life and destiny, help me focus my energy on the right part in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	



																																																													















MARCH 11							HOPE FOR A NEW DAY                                                         
		
																		SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 4:4-26
																																KEY VERSE: JOHN 4:14
						But whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
	
The woman in John 4 had live a life of disappointments, pouring the water of her hope in series of relationships that ended in grieve or abandonment. Jesus told the woman that if she knew who he was, she would be asking Him to fill her thirst with hope. Instead of offering this woman judgment and condemnation, He invited her into conversation, drawing her out and ultimately invites her into an external relationship with Him. This woman was amazed by her encounter with Jesus. Jesus knew her skeletons yet offered her salvation.
The woman was transformed. She goes back to town and seeks out men and women who had been trying to avoid her, inviting them to hear Jesus and have their life changed too. The woman�s hope was overflowing and her hope pour out in love towards other. Caring more about their future than the way she was treated in the past. How is your hope this week? Stop by the well of Jesus because He is the source of your hope for a better new day.

Prayer
Lord, let my life draw men unto you, fill me with your anointing in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.























MARCH 12  			                        SUPREMACY OF MAN OVER CREATION														     SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 1:26-28
																																KEY VERSE: GENESIS 1:26
					And God said; let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
	
Supremacy of man over creation looks at the level at which God has placed man in dominion over everything he created, our father Adam named the entire animal and the names he gave to them was pleasing to God.
God made us little lower than heavenly being and made all the works of his hands subject to our authority. This Authority was given unconditionally but man has not operated in the fullness of this authority and control equally from one generation to generation, and from one person to another.  
However, in as much as God gave man supreme power to dominate the earth and its creation, we are expected to have everything under our feet, if we believe in God. �Dominion is to be taken, are you taking charge�.

Prayer
Lord, I take my rightful position in dominion over the land, the sea and the air in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.





















MARCH 13                                                                                TEACH ME TO PRAY	                                                              
	
							SCRIPTURE READING: 1 JOHN 5: 14-15
																															KEY VERSE: LUKE 11:1
						And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

As a Christian, it is not good to settle for mediocrity, this has made a lot of unbeliever take control of our Economy, business, society and even politic influencing policies and decision. There is a great need for Christians pull towards a better prayer life and a deeper relationship with God. The earnest expectation of the creature awaits the manifestation of the sons of God to be revealed in glory and dominion.
Christ thought his disciples to pray and even on several occasions took them to solitary places to pray, at one occasion he said to them, can�t you watch for me for at least one hour. 
We must keep in mind when praying that prayer said according to the will of the father is prayers that receive ought most Priority.  
The order in the Lord�s Prayer clearly shows that Jesus firstly praised the Lord then he makes his request. Praising God first put us in the right frame of mind to tell him about our needs. Too often are prayers are more like shopping list than conversations. God�s provision is daily.

Prayer
Lord, teach me to pray aright in your will and purpose in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
























MARCH 14						        WEAPON OF WARFARE

																													SCRIPTURE READING: EPHESIANS 6:10-18
																															KEY VERSE: 2 CORINTHIANS 10:4
							For the weapon of our warfare are not canal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.
	
The warfare is a spiritual battle and it requires spiritual weapon to fight. Every Christian journey is a battle and you need to fight a good fight of faith. Satan is fighting every Christian so as to defeat and claim supremacy but God has given you everything to conquer the devil. The early you realize that you are dealing with a spiritual warfare the better you are able to prepare yourself spiritually.
However, the weapon of warfare is clearly stated in the scripture reading for today as not canal but mighty through God in pulling down stronghold.
Every Christian is in warfare against Satan and his host. Much also, every area of your life is subjected to Satan attack. He can attack your health, finance, academics, business, marriage including your spiritual life. His purpose is to take control of your life by snatching you from Gods hand. Meanwhile what you need to do is to fortify yourself with God�s word, live a holy life, fervent in prayer and God will grant you victory over Satan and his kingdom.

Prayer
Lord, lift up your standard against every adversaries confronting your work in my life, pull down every strong hold of the enemy in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.























MARCH 15							POWER OF THE TONGUE                                                         
		
																		SCRIPTURE READING: JAMES 3:5-7
																															KEY VERSE: PROVERB 18:12
							So is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

Tongue is a small part of the body but powerful. This same tongue can be use to cause confusion by uttering a word and it can also be used to make a positive change. It can be use for good or bad depending on the user. Often we do think tongue is just meant for uttering words irrespective of the kind of word. We even choose many times to say silly words because we do not understand the power in the tongue. It is so powerful that it can destroy a nation. 
However, we should know that once it�s spoken; it could be so sad that it can destroy life or save souls. It could give second chance and it could lead to winning or loss of friends, properties or life�s. You need to be careful what power you allow it to use. You need to understand that the little words from the tongue can cause sorrow, sadness, agony and pain to one�s life and others. Therefore, be conscious of the little words of yours; and determine to say words that will bring joy and gladness to you and others.

Prayer
Lord, position me to rightfully make use of the power in my tongue in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

							SCRIPTURE READING: EPHESIANS 4:17-24
																															KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 6:33
						But seek yr first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
	
When an individual becomes born again the character of Christ becomes visible in such person�s life if he follows the teaching of Christ. People should be able to differentiate between a Christian and a non Christian by their fruit. Leaving a Christian life is a process. Although we have a new nature, we don�t automatically express all right attitude but if we keep listening to God we will gradually become better in our thought, attitude and in our actions. The change might be slow but it will come as you trust in God to change you. 
Our old way of life before we believed is completely in the past. We should put it behind us like old cloths to be thrown away and commit our life to God in totality. You must study your bible daily, do not be content to skip through a chapter merely to satisfy your conscience. Hide the word of God in your heart; it comfort, guides and corrects, encourages, all we need is there. 

Prayer
Lord, strengthen my human mind to daily search through your word in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.






















MARCH 17			           	                           HAVING A HEART FOR GOD														                SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 16:1-13 
																														KEY VERSE: ACT 13:22
						And when he had removed him, he raised up for them David as king, to whom also he gave testimony and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.

Many places a high price on the externals, God examines deep within man for something more. Man judges one on the basis of one�s appearance, but God critiques the heart.
In Biblical thought, the heart was the central organ that controlled all activities thus determining one�s character of living. The heart housed the place where qualities worth having in our lives were first formed. This heart embodied the womb of character. David�s heart was right, he allowed God to mould and fashion his heart into that which would be pleasing to him. God focuses on his character more than physical stature. He concentrated on his integrity and not just outward looks. Developing a heart for God is not as difficult as it may sound. It involves concerning our heart with the concerns of God�s heart. We must develop those qualities that are worth having in our lives. Be humble. Humility is not lowliness or to be humiliated or to be abased. Humility is simply recognizing the grace and mercy of God. Have a heart for service. Service opens a flood gate of live giving resources to bring energy and power to one�s heart and devotion to God. David was a great sinner. But he was also a great repenter. He sinned desperately, but he wanted desperately not to sin. From David�s life, we learn that one does not have to be perfect to have a heart for God. Is the pressure of life drawing you toward the saviour? Expose your heart to the master physician.

Prayer
Lord, purify and make my heart your home. Concern my heart with the thought of you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.




	

	










MARCH 18		                     PRECIOUS IN THE HAND OF THE CREATOR														                SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 43:1-7 
																														KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 43:4
						Since you were precious in my sight you have been honoured, and I have loved you. Therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.

It�s amazing that God clearly demonstrated our value throughout the Bible. Imagine anything on this earth that we value and it�s incomparable to how God feels about us. In comparison to what other living things, humans are more precious in God�s sight. That is not a boastful claim; it is simply a statement that sets forth biblically truth.
Diamonds are incredibly valuable to us but to God, diamonds just aren�t that precious, nor are other costly stones or even gold. God has formed many diamonds but he made only one you, you are unique; you are unlike anyone else who has ever lived or ever will live. He made you because he wants someone exactly like you. He has plans for you. You may be feeling pretty worthless right now, beaten down, life has probably thrown more at you than you can handle. To you, you don�t feel worth as much as a rhinestone, let alone a diamond. Take heart! �You are precious in my eyes� God says. God never said he loved a diamond but he does say he loved you. The creator considers you, just one individual among earth�s billions, personally precious. The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Throw all your anxiety upon him, wrote the apostle Peter, �because he cares for you�.1 Peter 5:7.

Prayer
Lord, I appreciate your love and care for my life, help me to continually work with you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

						Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead and the people made him head and commander over them, and Jephthah spoke all his words before the God in Mizpeh.

Jephthah suffered as a result of another�s decision and not for any wrong he had done. Yet in spite of his brother�s rejection, God moved him into his purpose. God has a perfect divine plan and destiny set up for you and he will be the one to guide you every step of the way into the fulfilment of that divine plan. 
This now takes the burden off you in trying to find the next right job, the right spouse, the divine location for your business. God will now be guiding your steps, making sure that you�re always and in the specific place that he will want you to be at the exact time. He wants you to be there.
What this means is that if you go for something and do not get it, this means that God did not want you to have it so as to make sure that you did not go down a wrong path. So when you keep getting rejected, do not look at these rejections like you are a failure. Remember God already has the next plan, all set up and planned out for you. All you have to do is simply wait for his timing to bring it to you. He has a set time table in which all of these plans will manifest in your life. You simply have to learn how to have patience during these waiting periods.
Too many Christians are running their own lives and making their own choices instead of turning the reigns of their life over to God for him to fully handle. Only God knows what your true potentials are in this life, and he is the only one who can arrange to have those full potentials maximized and realized in life.

Prayer
Lord, bless me with wisdom, help me to make the right decision in life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















MARCH 20						WORKERS IN HIS VINEYARD

																												SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 20:1-16 
																															KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 20: 8
						So when even was come, the Lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, call the laborers, give them their hire beginning from the last to the first.

In the scripture reading, the landowner clearly represents the Lord, and the vineyard represents his kingdom. There is no reason to ask what kind of work they where suppose to do, because that is not the main thrust of the text. The story unfolds how the landowner wants to hire some men to work for him. They were employed at different hour of the day for the same purpose, to work in his vineyard. Working in the vineyard is a fairly solid image of serving in the Lord�s kingdom. The wages shows God�s gift, or reward for faithful service but the length of service and the amount of work does not determine what the reward is.
The landowner was unconventional in his mode of payment and they thought it was unfair that they are all paid same amount. He reminded them of the fact of the case and that ended the discussion. The payment he gave was according to what he promised them so they have no reason to admit that his judgment was unfair. He alone knows the value of each person�s service for his kingdom. However, when the reward comes from gracious Lord, they will be just and generous.

Prayer
	Lord, give me an increase passion for my service in the vineyard, separate me from everything that will distract my destiny in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	

	













MARCH 21 					            POWER FOR SERVICE
																												SCRIPTURE READING: LUKE 11:5-13
																														KEY VERSE: LUKE 11:13 
							If ye then, being evil, know to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

Most people become discouraged as they try to live for God and find they have failed in some areas. Some give up entirely. Others pretend to serve God while living in sin and excusing themselves by saying they simply cannot accomplish what the Bible says. The world�s standards, its values, its immorality, and its materialism constitute a formidable opposition to a Christian who wants to serve the Lord effectively. Satan also will do all he can to keep us from fulfilling God�s plan for our life. To accomplish the purpose of a Christian leaving a holy life, God has made rich provision; the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit indwells every Christian, and because he is God and has all the power of God, he is able to help us overcome our inadequacy and have a life.   
We need to depend moment by moment on the power to serve the Lord effectively. It is impossible for a believer to achieve what he should by way of obedience and commitment to God without relying upon the power of the Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit teaches us the truth we need. It rebukes us if we have transgressed. It provides a way of correction and shows how we should be living, and then it gives us training in how to live a righteous life before God.
Appropriately the spiritual power that God has provided is an important factor in a believer�s life and services. God has richly provided, we should avail ourselves by faith of what God has provided in his grace for our lifes.

Prayer
Lord, help me to properly position myself in what you are doing, give me the power to be faithful till the end in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


		










MARCH 22                                                                 APPEAL FOR RECONCILIATION

																											SCRIPTURE READING: 2 CORINTHIANS 6:1-13
																													KEY VERSE:  2 CORINTHIANS 7:2
						Receive us, we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.

Paul expected that he and the Corinthians believers should be workers working in the vineyard of God and if this is not happening, that means they had received the grace of God in vain. He was not convinced that all members in the church are born again and he pleaded for them to be reconciled to God. Paul was concerned to make sure that nothing made him hindrance to anyone seeking the Lord. The greatest hindrance to the successful propagation of the gospel is example of a believer who does not live for God.
Paul explains the reality by telling them of the difficulties he went through as a believer.
2 Corinthians 6:4-5. He listed things three things. �Affliction� this speaks of the oppressive situation. �Necessity� these are time when needs are not met. �Distresses� are situations which there seems to be no escape. It is in all their difficulties were they approved as a minister of God. He made himself totally transparent and exposes his inner feelings along with external difficulties that had been his. He defended himself. He had not been unjust in anyway, he had not spoil or ruined any person and he had not taken advantage of anyone.

Prayer
Lord, help me not to waste your grace in my life, help to align properly with the people you have position in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen. 















MARCH 23 					             TRUE WORSHIPPERS
																											SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 4:19-26
																													KEY VERSE: JOHN 4:23
							But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

Worship is an inner attitude and feeling of awe, reverence, gratitude, and love for God, resulting from a realization of who he is and who we are. It is quicken the conscience by the holiness of God, to feed the mind with the truth of God, to purge the imagination by the beauty of God. Worship is our innermost being responding with praise for all that God is, through our attitudes, actions, thoughts, and words based on the truth of God as he has revealed himself.
Worship by the way, is not music. It is much more than music. Music is just one way in which we express worship. Since God is seeking true worshippers, we should make it our priority to become such worshippers. Thus where we gather to worship is secondary. How and whom we worship is primary. God is seeking worshippers who will bring him glory, not just for an hour or Sunday, but everyday through all their activities. We can�t properly worship God on Sundays if we�re not worshipping him throughout the week. The fact that God is seeking true worshippers means that this is of utmost importance, it is our priority. Jesus says that these true worshippers must worship in spirit and truth. It�s a necessity .it isn�t optional. If you have trusted in Christ and perhaps have drifted off course, come back to this as your priority. If you are not growing as a true worshipper, you�re not in line with what God is seeking to do in your life. 

Prayer
Lord, raise true worshipper in our land, pull the heart of the men to true worship in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















MARCH 24 					         TREASURES OF THE HEART
																											SCRIPTURE READING: PROVERBS 4:20-27
																													KEY VERSE: LUKE 6:45 
					A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh

There is a direct correlation between what we treasure and the state of our hearts. We probably do have a pretty good idea of what we really get excited about and really desire. What we treasure is what we spend a lot of time thinking about. The heart is the seat of desires and affections and the true measure of a person.
In God�s mind, the heart is the central tissue. He is not interested in externalities, showmanship, performance, or smiles falsely pasted on our faces. He cares about who we really are on the inside. We ought to consider the state of our hearts because it will affect everything we think, do, and say. What we treasure will be burn out in what we do and what we say. We can suppress our actions or words for a time with extreme willpower, but ultimately the heart will win out because it is who we really are. God�s desire for us is that we would not be springs that yield both fresh and bitter water, therefore we should watch over, guard, and block our heart from any corrupt influence James 3:10-11. Such things ought not to be. What we say and what we do, as with what we think, should be driven by the leading of the Holy Spirit. We must transform our hearts so that we are no longer conformed to the ways of the world. It is only he who can give us self control which provides more consistency and persistency in our Christian lives. Sanctification is a process, but as we submit to our Lord, it will be accomplished.

Prayer
Lord, purify my heart, cleans my thought, let my love for you increase daily in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
		
















MARCH 25						OVERCOMING TEMPTATION

																											SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 39:7-12
																													KEY VERSE: 1 CORINTHIANS 10:13
						But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
	
Temptation can be simply explained as a test of faith or integrity. Human nature doubt God and still refuse to follow his leading even after seeing wondrous things God has done. We may never think we are spiritually strong enough not to be tempted to doubt and sin
1 Corinthians 10:12. Nobody is exempted from being tempted no matter your level spiritually. To be tempted is not a sin but to giving into temptation result in sin. Fortunately enough we don�t face the temptation alone, we have a father that will make a way for us to be victorious. 
Joseph was tempted by Potiphar wife but he never lusted after the wife of the Potiphar. He never worship idol, fornicate or murmured. He never allows overconfidence to take charge rather he looks for escape route out of the situation as God will always make a way out of every temptation. Don�t believe in the slogan �if you can�t beat them, you join them�. If you understand God displeasure when you compromise, it will give you what you need to overcome temptation.

Prayer
Lord, I am believe you paid the price for my victory, let the spirit of an overcomer rest upon me in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.






















MARCH 26			                                 SACRIFICIAL, JOYFUL GIVING

																											SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 22:1-19 
																													KEY VERSE: GENESIS 22:9 
							And bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

Sacrificial giving is the act of strategically giving something that is precious and costly or something one barely can afford as an act of worship and devotion to God with the purpose of getting uncommon breakthrough. It is well considered, but painful giving. This often requires that we give up something we love dearly as a demonstration that we are more committed to God and his purpose than to other things. Sometimes God may ask you to give up your dreams for his. This involves giving your talent, time, treasure and life. Sacrificial giving may come out of scarcity rather than abundance. 
When you give the preciousness of your scarce resources joyfully and when directed by God, it results to abundant supply and financial break through 1kings 17: 9-16. Sacrificial giving unlike freewill offerings, are given at specific times, to break something in the spirit. They are not as frequent as freewill offering. The scripture does not require a Christian to offer sacrifice regularly as it�s consider his life a sacrifice offering. It is however critical that at a strategic time a believer will be led by the spirit to offer sacrificially.

Prayer
Lord, I offer my life to you as a living sacrifice, take my all and use it for your glory in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.























MARCH 27 					         GROWING UP IN GOD
																											SCRIPTURE READING: EPHESIANS 4:13-15
																													KEY VERSE: 2 PETER 3:18
						But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and forever. Amen

The more we are filled, the more we become like the one who filled us. With Jesus our perfect example of spiritual maturity, what more could we hope for than to attain the whole measure of his fullness. 
If we were to look back over our lives we could all recognise stages of growth where we considered ourselves to be mature but with the advantage of additional rears we now either smile wryly at our naivety or cringe at our arrogance. We cannot say, we�ve finally arrived, I�m now mature in this life, but each day walked in fellowship with Jesus brings us that much closer. Spiritual maturity doesn�t happen automatically. You can be a Christian and never grow up spiritually. Hebrew 5:12-13. 
Spiritual maturity is not automatic. Growing up in God takes time and effort. It takes and intentional pursuit and it won�t happen without discipline. The more disciplined you become the more God can use you. Luke 9:23. It takes to give Christ first place in your life and commit to the habits necessary for growing. You need your Bible. Bible is like an instruction manual for a car owner without it life is hard at best, impossible at worst. It doesn�t do us a bit good unless we read it. It is God�s way of preparing us in every way, fully equipped for every good thing God want us to do.
You need to build a relationship with God through prayer, fellowshipping with him in regular service. Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness. You can attain the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. 

Prayer
Lord, as I wait on your word, expend your light in my heart, make it shine brighter and brighter in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.












MARCH 28 			                         	      RESPONSES TO SUFFERING

																											SCRIPTURE READING: LAMENTATIONS 3:1-6
																													KEY VERSE: LAMENTATION 3:22-23
						It is of the Lord�s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness

Suffering is anything which hurts or irritates. In the design of God, it is something to make us think. It is a tool God uses to get our attention and to accomplish his purpose in our lives. It is designed to build our trust in God, but suffering requires the right response if it is to be successful in accomplishing God�s purposes. Suffering forces us to turn from trust in our own resources to living by faith in God�s resources.
Sometimes we suffer because we live in a world where sin reigns. At times it is because of our own foolishness. We reap what we sow; we may also suffer persecution because of our faith. However, rarely does suffering not reveal areas of need, weakness, and wrong attitudes that need to be removed like dross in the gold refining process. Many of us think we suffer because of our circumstances. We believe that if our circumstances would change, we�d be able to act right. But God wants us to become so mature and stable during suffering, that we act right even when none of our circumstances are good. 
Suffering is harmful when we become harden and reject God. We allow it to make us self-centred and selfish. We reject the fact that God can bring good out of calamity. We accuse God of being unjust and refuse to be open to any changes in our lives. Don�t give up on God because you are experiencing a bad situation. 
God is capable of rescuing us from suffering. It is Satan�s strategy to get us doubt God at exactly this moment. Consistent faith is the way to defeat Satan.
There are different levels of faith and most of the time we want to use our faith to get rid of a problem. But sometimes God�s plan is for us to exercise a higher level of faith that will carry us through life�s challenges. 

Prayer
Lord, give me the grace to patiently endure in times of suffering in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	











MARCH 29 					         CASTING ALL ANXIETIES
																											SCRIPTURE READING: 1 PETER 5:6-11
																													KEY VERSE: PSALM 55:22 
							Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

One of the greatest things about God is that he commands us to let him work for us before commanding us to work for him. Overtime God has declared and shown his ability and his willingness to be our strength and support, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. He is able and best of all, willing to take everything that threatens to overwhelm us and use it for our benefit. But it is sometimes a disconcerting truth for many Christians that even though; we belong to God through faith in Christ, we still seem to experience the same problems that plagued us before we were saved. We often become discouraged and bogged down in life�s cares.     .
	God knows problems and worries are inevitable in this life. Thankfully, he has given us the solution to overcome our fears and worries by casting it all on him. God is bigger than all our worries and problems put together, and we must realize that if we are to have any victory in our lives. We must not let Satan deceive us into thinking that all our problems are our fault, all our worries will come true, all our prayers condemns us, or that all our guilt is from God. We need not to feel ashamed, but rather take God at his word. God not only calls us to be bold but he also makes a provision for us to get rid of our fear and anxieties, he wants to be a burden bearer because it demonstrates his power. Trust that he cares for you. He cares about the things that have you worrying. As we cast our anxieties on God, he relieves us of worry, fear and any other care that is proving too heavy to carry. He frees us from a sense of helplessness and hopelessness. 

Prayer
Lord, I cast all my worries and burdens on you, make me experience your peace in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















MARCH 30 					               SWITCH TO SUCCESS

																											SCRIPTURE READING: EZRA 7:10
																													KEY VERSE: NEHEMIAH 6:6
							Wherein was written. It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.   

		A young undergraduate student had carried over in his course of study but didn�t see anything bad in it. It was just like a normal thing every student must experience in tertiary institution. He had carried this course that the lecturer knows him as unserious student. This continue till this guy got to 400level and things change completely. When he wrote the course in his final year, he was the only student that had distinction in that course. The lecturer was amaze and said this is God in action.
This story shows that success and failure has a switch button. What happened to this young guy between 100level and 400level is a switch. He has been dealing with friend that their idea and action is to celebrate failure. Unknown to his lecturer, the guy has made another switch to disassociate from friends that celebrate failure. Success is a switch and you can switch your mindset to success today. Whether people like it or not, they will be forced to celebrate with you.

Prayer
Lord, align me with people that will pull me to my place of glory and disassociate me from every unproductive association in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.






																																																																					














MARCH 31 					                 HEAVEN OUR HOME

																											SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 14:1-18
																													KEY VERSE: JOHN 14:3
							And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.

When the Lord Jesus is able to count upon the sorrow of the hearts that will miss Him, he said,� Let not your heart be troubled, in my Father�s house are many mansions.� What a revelation. There had been no such thing up to this time in the scripture. Much of the Lord ministry had prepared the way for it; now the moment has come for the full revelation to break on us, a home where He has gone, His own home, now revealed and made ours.
Jesus told the disciple that �I go to prepare a place for you.� There is nothing more important than to know the meaning of that short sentence: it is not that any preparation is going on now but how did we ever come to have a home prepare up there? It is accomplished redemption that prepares us for it. The Lord Jesus perfecting our history here opens to us a heavenly home. He died for us to qualify for the kingdom and left to prepare the place for us. Is heaven your home? It is only those that accept him and forsake their ways are entitled to have heaven as their home.

Prayer
Lord, I pray this day that the heart of the lost will be draw to you, keep me steadfast till the end in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	






















APRIL 1  							GRATEFUL HEART
	
																														SCRIPTURE READING: LUKE 17:11-19
																																KEY VERSE: LUKE 17:15
						And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turn back, and with a loud voice glorify God.

Most times blessing or change of situation from bad to good makes you forget the need to appreciate God. Often you do think the blessing you received was your right and this makes you not to see any reason to give thanks to God. Some time you think you deserve what you get base on your skill, exposure or self righteousness. However, you seem not to be grateful because you think it is part of someone responsibility due to his status or personality to do something�s for you.
Most time you move on from the spot you get solution to your problem and you never look back like the ten leper discussed in today�s reading. Such life is what most people live and don�t see any big deal in it. However, something happened to one leper out of ten that went back to give thanks. He was blessed by the second time. Your ungrateful will limit your blessing while being grateful opens more doors of blessing. Learn to be grateful and your blessing will be unlimited.

Prayer
Lord, am so grateful for all that you have done and all that you are doing in my life, I appreciate you for that which you are yet to do in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	





















APRIL 2 					               GOD�S SHEPHERD HEART

																											SCRIPTURE READING: PSALM 95:7-11
																													KEY VERSE: JEREMIAH 3:15
									And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

A shepherd hearts take care of his flock; strengthen the weak and sick, search for the lost. Rule lovingly and gently gather and protect the sheep. Above all give his best to the sheep. A hired hand tends the sheep for mercy, while the shepherd does it for love. The resources of a shepherd are the flock provision. The presence of a shepherd is the comfort of his flock during hard times and the discipline of a shepherd is for the good of his flock. The shepherd owns the sheep and is committed to them.
God alone controls the depths and the heights; he alone formed the sea and the earth. What an image of authority and power! No other god can match � let alone exceed-God�s rule and might. He is our God; we are the people he cares for, the flock for which he provides. Ps.95:7. God�s power is channelled to meet the needs of those whom God has taken under his care. 
Trust God for guidance and direction, whenever you lack direction let God shepherd you. A hardened heart is as useless as a hardened lump of clay or a hardened loaf of bread; nothing can restore it and make it useful. The time has come for you to strip hardening your heart by continuing to resist God�s leadership, guidance and direction. Allow your creator take over from here to shepherd your scattered life. 

Prayer
Lord, I pray for all the pastor in our various ministry, give them the word for the time, help them to fulfil your mandate on their life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	


















APRIL 3					                    CHRIST OUR SUBSTITUTE

																											SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 53:6-8
																													KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 53:12
									Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors 
	
Christ is the suffering servant: he suffered physical pain disfigurement; he experienced the emotion and mental suffering of human scorn and rejection. He suffered death. But above and beyond this suffering, which to varying extents is common to us all. He suffered the full penalty of God�s just judgement on sin � not his own sin, for he had no sin, but for ours. 
Thus Isaiah tells us that when Jesus died he was paying the penalty for our transgressions, he was taking the wrap for our iniquities, and because he took our punishment the breach between us and God has been healed and we are brought into a state of peace with God.
Without opening his mouth to defend his personal innocence, without opening his mouth to summon legions of angels to rescue him, Jesus, knowing his mission was to bear in his body the iniquity of us all, put himself as substitute under the judgement of God. 
He was punished in our place. He bore God�s judgement on our behalf. There is no punishment left for us to bear. There is no judgement left to fall upon us. There is no guilt left to condemn us.
He took it all upon himself. He placed himself between the wrath of God and us. And we go free, free from God�s judgement, free from sin�s punishment, free from guilt and condemnation. Justified acquitted.

Prayer
Lord, let not your suffering be in vain in my life, let it establish it fullness in my salvation in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















APRIL 4					              CHRIST, THE ANOINTED ONE

																										SCRIPTURE READING: ISAIAH 61:1-4
																												KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 61: 1
								The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.  

Relatively few people has claimed kingship, some took up priesthood mission, while quit a higher number claimed to be prophets. But just one person has claimed to be all and God. He who brought good news, salvation, justice, laughter and healing etc. Jesus the messiah. The anointed one, the one chosen and appointed by God to fulfil his eternal plan, foretold by the prophets living before he was born.
Many expected that when he came as a political leader conquering hero who would set the nation of Israel free from her oppressors, and who, after re-establishing the throne and dynasty of David, would restore Israel to her former national and economic glory.
The Christ comes not to usher in a physical political kingdom, but a spiritual kingdom. Ephesians 1:3. In Christ, we have all benefits of knowing God, being chosen for salvation, being adopted as his children, forgiveness, insight, the gift of the spirit, power to do God�s will the hope of living forever with Christ. Because we have ultimate relationship with God, we can enjoy these blessings now. These blessings are eternal not temporal.
Those who have been held captive by sin, law and death are set free to live without fear and guilt in the presence of God. Romans 8:1. Those who have been trapped in the darkness of spiritual ignorance are released into the light of knowledge of God in Jesus Christ. John 8:12.

Prayer
Lord, pull me out of spiritual ignorance, release me into the light of your knowledge in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















APRIL 5 				               THE POWER OF THE LIVING GOD

																											SCRIPTURE READING: 2 KINGS 19:1-7
																													KEY VERSE: 2 KINGS 19:32-33
						Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into the city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. By the way that he came, by the sane shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord.

In the culture of that era, gods were understood as local, territorial and tribal gods. The concept of one God who was the one God over all the earth was unique to Israel. Thus, when one tribe or people defeated another this was seen as evidence that the god of the victorious nation was stronger than the god of the defeated nation.
Assyria had destroyed many nations, thus proving the gods of those nations powerless. Sennacherib assumed that the God of Israel was like the gods of the nations. We serve the living God. The God who made heaven and earth, the sea and all things that is in them. He is the origin of life on earth. We do not bow to a lifeless image, marble statue that cannot see, hear, feel nor think. We bow to a true, most powerful living God, our creator, our protector who watches over us, loves us, hears our prayers and intervenes.
Sennacherib, whose armies had captures all the fortified cities of Judah sent a message to Hezekiah to surrender. Realizing the situation was hopeless. Hezekiah went to the temple prayed. God answered and delivered Judah by sending an army to attack the Assyrian camp, forcing Sennacherib to leave at once. Although Assyria was a world power, it could not conquer Judah.
God has proved himself powerful in several ways in the scripture, which are available to us, in helping us build our faith yet we have succeeded in giving up on hopeless situations in our life�s. We became fearful when faced with battles and challenges of life, when we are to bring to remembrance how God rescued the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he led them into the wilderness, where the menu was a miraculous provision of manna.
Instead of being helpless, hopeless and fearful, why not do what Hezekiah did by laying all your battles and challenges at God�s feet. He remains the most powerful and ready to prove it to you.    

Prayer
Lord, send destruction into the camp of my enemy, display your great work before the nations that they might know that you are my God in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.








APRIL 6 				OBEDIENCE AND THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD														                        SCRIPTURE READING: 1 SAMUEL 15:1-11 
																																				KEY VERSE: 1 SAMUEL 15:22
							And Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and hearken than the fat of rams.

Sovereign means highest, supreme power, superior in position, independent of and unlimited by anyone else. To be sovereign is to posses supreme power and authority so that one is in complete control and accomplish wherever he pleases. God is said to be absolutely free because no one and nothing can hinder him or compelled him or stop him. He is able to do as he pleases always, everywhere and forever. Sovereignty means that God is God infact, as well as in name, directing all thing, working all things. At his pleasure the Red sea divided and its waters stood up as walls. Exodus 14.When he ordered, the sun stood still. Joshua 10. 
Whatsoever he pleased, that did    in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. Psalm 135:6. 
God is unique in his knowledge and in his control. His consistent purpose is to carry out what he has planned. When we are tempted to pursue anything that promises pleasure, comfort, peace or securing, we must remember the sovereignty of God. One of the things that set the Bible apart from other holy is its uncompromising honesty about the human condition. God calls us to obey him out of his concern for our best. Sometimes that means we must make hard choices. Too often instead of making up our minds to obey God no matter what, we choose to compromise when faced with situations where obedience is hard, especially when it seems meaningless from the earthly stand point.
God has the final say to everything in life whether we chose to obey him or not. But if we obey it is for our own good. In our moment of decision, we should acknowledge the sovereignty of God and be fully aware that he is able to do as he pleases always for he is an independent God.

Prayer
Lord, help me not to take your instruction as an option, give me the heart to obey you in all things in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.













APRIL 7 					                  JUDGEMENT AND GRACE

																											SCRIPTURE READING: JONAH 3:1-4
																													KEY VERSE: 1 JOHN 1:9
							If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
	
You know God is so much kinder than most people think he is. We tend to think that God is just a much bigger better than us. He�s not just better, he is holy. He�s not just bigger, he�s almighty. Consequently, he does things that we wouldn�t even dream of doing. God promise to judge, but also promise grace. Jonah had run away from God, but was given a second chance.
The Scriptures however are full of examples of God giving people second chances to serve him after they have failed. (Peter in John 21). Do you need to ask God for a second chance to obey him today?
Confession is supposed to free us to enjoy fellowship with God. It should ease our consciences and lighten our heart in any case. God want to forgive us. True confession also involves a commitment not to continue in sin. We wouldn�t be genuinely confessing our sins to God, if we planned to commit them again and just wanted temporary forgiveness. Our Grace is God�s free and unmerited favour for sinful humanity.
Another aspect of God�s great loving-kindness is seen in the message he asks Jonah to give to the Ninevites. Judgment- �Nineveh will be overthrown�� and grace- �yet forth days�. Why give a deadline? Because, he wants them to repent. God wants to forgive us. He wants to offer repentance to believers a second chance. 

Prayer
Lord, cleans me from every secret fault, let your mercy locate me in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.


















APRIL 8					                           PEACE POURED OUT

																										SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 14:27
																												KEY VERSE: PHILIPPIANS 4:7
							And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

Since we have been made right with God by our faith and the grace of God, our salvation brings peace with God. Peace is therefore poured into our hearts and minds because it is essential to our Christian life. The end result of the Holy Spirit�s work in our lives is deep and lasting peace. Unlike worldly peace, this is usually defined as the absence of conflict.
Peace is found in resting, which is the idea Jesus talked about as he encourages his followers to remain in him. Seven times he says �remain in me� like a branch on a vine that rest in just remaining attached to its source of substance.
Rest means you don�t have to do anything. What could you do anyway? Possibly you have tried every avenue and peace has eluded you. Maybe you feel you don�t deserve God�s peace. For whatever reason you can�t bring yourself to ask for what you don�t deserve.
2 Timothy 2:13 says �if we are not faithful, he remains faithful, because he cannot be false to himself.� God is faithful and you can trust him to pour peace into your life because he promised he would.
If you are having the feeling of not receiving enough of the peace of God, simply tell the Lord all about it. Feel it, own it and give it to the Lord. Then leave it there and go about the day�s work. Jesus says, �ask for anything you wish, and you shall have it�. John 15:7. And that include his unique peace unlike anything the world offers. With Christ peace, we have no need to fear the present or the future.

Prayer
Lord, let me abound in you peace, calm every storm troubling my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















APRIL 9					                           GRACE UNWRAPPED

																											SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 3:21-26
																													KEY VERSE: HEBREWS 4:16
										Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

Everyone likes present. There is definitely something universally wonderful about given a gift that was picked out specially and specifically for you. Hopefully we all know what it is like to unwrap a present that was picked out just for us. God has given us the very best gift we could ever imagine, �Grace�. Grace, as described in the Bible and taught by Jesus, is undeserved and unearned favour. Grace is God rescuing us even when there is nothing we can do to pay for or earn it.
When a judge in a court of law decides the defendant not guilty, all the charges are removed from his record. Legally it is as if the person had never been accused. When God forgives our sins, our record is wiped clean from his perspective; it is as though we had never sinned. There is a way to be declared guilt not by trusting Jesus to take away our sins. He is the grace we cannot pay for. Trusting means putting our confidence in Christ to forgive our sins, to make us to live the way he taught us. God�s solution �GRACE� is available to all of us regardless of our background or past behaviour.
Christ is our propitiation, our sacrifice of atonement. God declares Christ�s death to be the appropriate, designated sacrifice for our sin. Christ then stands in our places, having paid the penalty of death for our sin, and he completely satisfies God�s demands. His sacrifice brings pardon, deliverance, freedom and above all grace. Don�t minimize little sin or overrate big sins. They all separate us from God, but they all can be forgiven. God�s grace is taking your nothingness and making you something. You don�t even have to be good. Just acknowledge that you failed and you are sorry. He will make his grace sufficient for you.   

Prayer
Lord, let your mercy fall on me, help me to seek after does things that are pleasing to you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.















APRIL 10 					                 IT�S ALL WE�VE GOT

																											SCRIPTURE READING: ECCLESIASTES 9:1-12
																													KEY VERSE: ECCLESIASTES 9:10
										Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest
	
A wise man once said, �Your life may not be what you want, but it�s all you�ve got�. These really are nothing else � we are alive, or we are dead. The same fate awaits all � rich, poor; young, old; ugly, handsome; wise, foolish. The dead know nothing and there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in death. Considering the uncertainties of the future Solomon recommends enjoying life as God�s gift while we are able.
If we are alive then there are certain uncertainties which face every one of us. None of us knows the future. None of us knows what tomorrow may bring. None knows whether or not there will be a tomorrow for us. We cannot safeguard our life. We can eat the best food, have the best medical attention, live the healthiest conditions- and go out and get hit by a bus.
We cannot guarantee success in life. Sometimes a small group of guerrillas can defeat a larger army; a rich investor can make one wrong decision on the stock market and her wealth is gone; the most brilliant scientist can make a mistake in his calculations.
But to look at things from a slightly different view-point, another wise man once said, �While there�s life, there�s hope�. We are encouraged to enjoy life- now while we have the chance. Food and drink are basic gifts from God and were meant to give us pleasure. We should in fact enjoy all God�s good gifts- our families, our homes, our friends, our jobs.
We are to take every opportunity life gives us to make the most of life itself with the energy, intelligence, knowledge and wisdom that God has given us.

Prayer
	Lord, beautify my life with your true riches, help me make good use of my time and resources in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
	
















APRIL 11 				WHEN OUR DREAMS ARE NOT REALIZED

																											SCRIPTURE READING: JEREMIAH 45:1-5
																													KEY VERSE: JEREMIAH 45:5
											And seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not. For, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh saith the Lord: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

Dreams are wonderful! They allow us to imagine all kinds of scenarios that will bring us happiness or success. Sometimes we see them fulfilled but often they remain a tantalizing �reality� just out of reach! It can be quite difficult to cope when our dreams are not realized.
Everyone has dreams, no matter what age. But along the line, somewhere between the womb and the tomb, those dreams become shattered dreams. Even sincere Christians with God given dreams find themselves bruised blooded at the bottom of a pity.
Baruch was a man who was struggling with the reality of his life. His choice to act as Jeremiah�s secretary had cost him dearly. He looked back and thought about what might have been. As a member of a respected family in Jerusalem his future had seemed assured. He was trained as a scribe and everything about his life suggested that he could expect to gain a place of status within the royal court in Jerusalem. All that changed when he became associated with the unpopular prophet Jeremiah.
God has given you a dream, the desire to be great and to accomplish something of significance. But for your dream to be fulfilled, you the dreamer needs to be refined because it is not the dream that gets tested, it is you the dreamer. In so many cases the reason why dreams are not realized is because we don�t work on it. Work on your dream with God, he will makes it a reality. Even though when your dreams are yet to be realized, they are never wasted in God�s plan. Value the life that you do have. God�s purposes will be fulfilled by our faithfulness to him whatever our circumstances. The challenge is to trust the God who has called us into relationship with himself. We need to recognize when reality replaces our dream.

Prayer
Lord, refine my heart, let none of my expectation be cut short, fulfil your word in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen. 











APRIL 12  						BLOCKAGES AND HINDRANCES													               SCRIPTURE READING: MARK 2:1-12
																													KEY VERSE: MARK 2:4-5 
								And when they could not come nigh unto him for they press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
	
In Palestine at this time an open door meant an open invitation to anyone inclined to visit. When word got around that Jesus was in town a crowd gathered, filling the house he was staying in and spilling over into the street. Into this situation came a group of men bringing their paralysed friend to Jesus to be healed. But they couldn�t get to where they wanted to be in relation to Jesus. What stopped them? The crowd blocked the way, but only temporarily! These men carried their friend up the stairs to the roof. You can just picture Jesus teaching when all of a sudden dirt begins to fall on his head. The men lower their paralyzed friend through. It wasn�t the paralytic�s faith that impressed Jesus, but the faith of his friends. Jesus responded to their faith and healed the man. These men were very resourceful and bold, exercising an active faith. Even though they came up against blockages and hindrances that might have stopped others, they persevered by faith until they got to where they wanted to be with Jesus. They weren�t sorry! For better for worst, our faith affects others. We cannot make another person a Christian, but we can do much through our words, actions and love to give him or her chance to respond.
Pause to consider that blockages and hindrances that can prevent us too from getting to where  we want to be with Jesus. A �crowd� of distraction and deception can block the way between us and him. Our own condition � whether inner or outer � can hinder us. It might seem at times that there�s no way to get through them, to get to where we want to be with Jesus. Be encouraged by the persistent faith of these men. Determine that nothing will prevent you from drawing ever closer to Jesus. There is a way around every �blockages� and Jesus has already dealt with our condition. Press on! Press in! 

Prayer
Lord, I pull every blockages and hindrances preventing me from accessing heavenly provision for my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen. 
	











APRIL 13                        	                                                                     MAKING PLANS 
	
									SCRIPTURE READING: JAMES 4:13-16
																																		KEY VERSE: JEREMIAH 10:23
						O Lord, I know that the way of a man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

	Christian sometimes made faulty assumptions in determining God�s will. We thought that the Holy Spirit leads people only in a simultaneous way. We reject the idea that we could hear the spirit�s voice through the scriptures. We thought that our feelings were an infallible guide for sensing the leading of the Holy Spirit and made up no plans, set no gaols, aimed at nothing because we wanted to be always open to the leading of the Holy Spirit. But the apostles made plans, and even Jesus himself made plans. Romans 1:13, Acts 6:1-3, Matthew 10:15.  Surely we cannot claim that these men were not spirit led in their planning.
On more than one occasion in Paul missionary travels, he planned to invade a region with the gospel but the spirit of God prevented him. Acts 16:6-7. Although Paul planned, yet he was sensitive to the word altering his plans. In making plans we should use our God given intellect, use our mind and don�t neglects our heart and do not assume omniscience, for we do not really know everything.
Often our anxiety about the future underlies our desire to control all aspects of our life. It is good to have goals, but goals will disappoint us if we leave God out of them. There is no point in making plans as though God does not exist, because the future is in his hands. What would you like to be doing 10years from now? One year from now? Tomorrow? The immature Christian gives where he or she wants to go, but the mature Christians goes where the father wants them to go. How will you react if God steps in and rearranges your plans? Plan ahead, but hold your plans wisely. Put God�s desire at the centre of your planning: he will never disappoint you. 

Prayer
Lord, let my plan align with yours, help me to go where you want me to go and be what you want me to be in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: LUKE 14:28-29
																																		KEY VERSE: LUKE 14:28
										For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
		
								The concept of management started when God created heaven and earth and gave man absolute authority and control over it. When God delegated some of his authority to the human race, he expected us to take responsibility. We must not be careless and wasteful as we fulfil this charge. Considering the economy situations of our country, managing the available resources we have is inevitable. Budgeting to help you rage your income and spending prudently is of great necessity. It will help take care of your basic needs as well as put aside amounts for savings and possibly investments to meet your other goals. Make proper planning on money you can count on, money at hand. Do not count on money you�re not sure you will earn for spending. If you have a surplus think about how you can use the money prudently and if it is deficit, adjust your budget, see where you can cut expenses. Think hard on what you really need and can afford.
Don�t get indebted on unnecessary things, even if you are in need of it at that moment, and you can�t afford it, let it go. Avoid taking on excessive debt. It is important to be able to distinguish your needs from your wants. Needs are goods and services you require in your life. Wants are those things you desire. There are periods in our life�s, when we might not be able to have and access our desires, due to non availability of the resources needed. Time and season changes, all you need to do is to adjust to the present situation of things by managing your resources. Be contented and make yourself happy. Prioritize your goals, identify suitable action and steps to help you close the short fall and reach your goal. Limit your borrowing to only when it is really necessary.

Prayer
Lord, broaden my knowledge to be able to rightly apportion, deliver me from every indebtedness help me to leave a debt free life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

							But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again, and you reward shall be great, and ye shall be children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.      

Our dignity comes because we are made in the image of God. Our significance comes because we are called by Jesus to be world changers. Our power and strength comes because we are filled with the Holy Spirit who gives us the ability to receive the insults of others and respond as Christ responded to those who hurled insults at him. To turn the other cheek is neither humanity nor retaliation. It is rather a response of strength that says, �I will not seek revenge because I am stronger than that.� It also says, I will not respond in shame because I have dignity in Christ. My dignity is not found in if I can hit you back and hurt you. My dignity is found in Christ and I will respond in just the way he would respond. 
Revenge belongs to God. If vengeance is God�s, then it is not ours. God has not asked us to settle the same or get even. Even judgment is God�s job. To assume otherwise is to assume God can�t do it. When we are mistreated, our animalistic response is to go on the hunt. Instinctively, we double up our fists. Getting even is only natural which incidentally is precisely the problem. Revenge is natural, not spiritual. Getting even is the rule of the jungle.    Giving grace is the rule of the kingdom.

Prayer
Lord, give me a forgiven heart even when my flesh seek for vengeance in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 12:17-21
																																		KEY VERSE: PROVERBS 20-22  

X-ray the soul of the vengeful and behold the tumor of bitterness. Its total fibres creep around the edge of the heart and revenge it. Yesterday you can�t alter, but your reaction to yesterday you can. The past you cannot change, but your response to the past you can.
Revenge is irreverent. When we strike back we are saying, �I know vengeance is yours, God, but I just didn�t think you�d punish enough. I thought I�d better take this situation into my own hands. You have a tendency to be a little soft.� To forgive someone is to display reverence. Forgiveness is not saying the one who hurt you was right. Forgiveness is stating that God is fair and he will do what is right. All justice ultimately is in the hand and the heart of God.  
A forgiving spirit demonstrate that a person has received God`s forgiveness. The life of a Christian is to be lived with such a quality of spiritual veracity and justice that he needs no physical retaliation in order to defend or justify his position. There is no greater example of this truth than the life and death of Christ.     

Prayer
Lord, help me to always see as you see so as for me to find strength in my weakness in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
























APRIL 17  						                           GOOD SOIL I

																															SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 13:1-23
																																	KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 13:23                    
										But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it: which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

Jesus uses something�s we see every day to help us understand a spiritual truth that we can�t see with our eyes. Farming experts know just what kind of soil is needed for their crops. They will add the right kind of fertilizer so their plants can grow into large, healthy plants. If it is done right, a handful of seeds will produce bushes full of good things to eat. Jesus said that the same seed produced no crops, some crop or a great crop. The seed was the same in every place, but the condition of the soil was different.
The seed that is sown is the gospel, the good news about Jesus. The soils are the hearts of the people who make a choice about the message. The condition of a person�s heart can be compared to the different kinds of soils that received the seed.
Some people hear the truth, but like hardened paths, they do not let it sink into their hearts Zechariah 7:12. Soon the devil takes the truth away. If you do not receive and respond to. the word with faith, your opportunity might be stolen by the evil one.
	Next, some of the seed fell into rocky places. You hear the message with great joy, but like seeds on rocky soil, you do not let it take root. You seem to be happy to hear, but you do not let it sink into your hearts. On the outside, you express great enthusiasm, but inwardly you do not carefully consider it. They have no root to your belief: no substance to your relationship with the sower. Still other seed fell among thorns. You hear God�s word and start to grow and bear fruit. But soon you became worried about the problems of daily living.
The deceitfulness of wealth chokes it, making it unfruitful. Fear of circumstances, outweighs faith in God�s word. Alternative empty sources of hope are sought. You think if you only had more money and more things you would be happy. These wrong beliefs take up all your time and energy, just like the weeds steal all the nutrients from the good plants. You should trust God to deliver you from worries so that you can grow in God�s words. 

Prayer
Lord, fertilize my land, let your word mix with faith in my heart, help me to be fruitful in all areas of my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.











APRIL 18 						                           GOOD SOIL II

																															SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 13:1-23
																																	KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 13:23                    
										But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it: which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

All seeds contain nutrients and energy inside of a hard protective coating. First the seed is buried in the ground. When the seed is in good soft, warm soil, it sends out a little root that goes down into the spoil. It gets enough energy to start growing. With the sun shining on the stalk and nutrients getting into the root from the rain and soil, more roots grow, and plant begins to thrive. 
Isn�t it great to know that some of the seed fell on good soil? Those who hear the word and understand it. This is not all understanding that sits back with a smug sense of self-satisfaction. It is an understanding that grows and multiplies as knowledge of the Sower develops and matures. It receives and applies the word of God confidently. It produces abundant fruit in accord with faith in action.
At different times throughout life we might identify with any of those four conditions. Pray that the Holy Spirit will enable you to become increasingly like the fourth example Jesus gave. The person like this is not easily uprooted or distracted but goes from strength to strength in God.

Prayer
Lord, uproot all weed geminating in place of wheat in my land, increase my harvest this season in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: ACTS 2:36-39
																																		KEY VERSE: I CORINTHIANS 11:1	
							Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.	

There is much more to being a genuine follower of Christ than most people think. We are generally anxious to be considered and called a true Christian but we personally can�t defend the genuity of our Christianity. One major step in defining a true and genuine Christian according to Apostle Paul is by imitating him just as he imitated Christ.  At this time the Corinthian believers did not know much about the life and ministry of Christ. Paul couldn�t tell them to imitate Jesus, because the gospels had not yet been written, so they did not know what Jesus was like. The best way to point these new Christians to Christ was to point them to a Christian whom they trusted but there is more to be a genuine Christian.
To be a genuine Christian, a person must take a vital step.  Your sins had necessitated the death of the only Son of God, so you must genuinely repent. Repentance is not an emotional experience. It is a life changing process. This process of change, of surrendering yourself and turning your life over to God, is called conversion. It is obvious you cannot change everything at once, but one can have a repentant attitude and turn in the right direction, making basic changes as he or she embarks on a new path and a new life of overcoming, bearing fruits worthy of repentance. Matthew 3:8. 
God has revealed all truth to us through his word, the bible, so that we understand what a genuine Christian is and apply it to our daily living. Receive the gospel, not the message about how Jesus can help you succeed in life, but rather about how Jesus alone can rescue you from the wrath to come. 

Prayer
Lord, help me identify every area of my life that I need to work upon, raise Godly disciples of man in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 12:5-8
																																		KEY VERSE: 1 PETER 4:10
								As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 

God created you, he made an investment in you and he expects a return on that investment. You are a manager of the talents God has given you. They may be great or small in your eyes, but they matter to the giver. He has given you a unique ability called Talents that makes you who you are and sets you apart from other people. God gave you talents to benefit others, not yourself. And God gave others talents that benefit you. Some people are well aware of their abilities; believe that they have the right to use their abilities as they please. Others feel that they have no special talents at all. Everyone has some talents, find yours and use them. All our abilities should be use in serving others; none are for our own exclusive enjoyment. We are all a part of the body of Christ and each part matters. Nobody is insignificant in the family of God. We are shaped to serve God and he is watching to see how we will use the abilities he gave us.
Use the talents given to you by God to make yourself a better person and the world a better place. If you use it, it will grow. If you don�t, you will lose it. Like the parable of the ten talents in Luke 19, if you don�t use it, if you are afraid to use it or if you get lazy to use it to benefit others, you are going to lose it. God wants you to steward those gifts for him. If you want to please God, you must faithfully use your talents the way he want you to. 1 Corinthians 4:2. Whatever you do, do it for God and not for man. For everything you do points back to God. Use it to glorify him.

Prayer
Lord, make me not to be selfish in using of my talent to pursue and bring people to your kingdom in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 24:45-51
																																		KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 24:46
									Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 

There are two servants found in this parable and the responsibility given to them is very clear. Simple responsibility to give food to the other servants at the proper time. That was all that was asked of these servant.   The food, was not the servants food, it was the master�s food and the house as well. Nothing that the servant was responsible for was actually his, it was all the master. In fact, the servant himself was the matter�s property. So basically, the servant was asked to dispense the master�s food, in the master�s house, for the master�s servants and to do it faithfully at the proper time. The first servant obeyed the master�s commands. And when the master returned unexpectedly, he found the servant being faithful in his task.
The second servant convinced himself that the master was gone for a long time. He confused the unexpected return with an indefinitely delayed return. Convincing himself that he had the time in the world and became diverted from his primary responsibility. His lack of faithfulness had an impact both inside and outside of the house. When the master suddenly showed up as he had promised to do unexpectedly, he took his wicked servant and shredded him because of his disobedience.
Applying the parable to our present day situation, do we consider our responsibilities, to be faithful as we wait in readiness for the Lord�s return, we should believe that there is a great reward for each of us.

Lord, help me not to divert from my primary responsibility to you, help me guild my mission on earth jealously in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: MATTHEW 24:36-44
																																		KEY VERSE: MATTHEW 24:44
				Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

God has entrusted much to us. He has given us his truth. Receiving God�s truth carries with it a responsibility. To whom more is given, much is expected. Each of us is responsible to be an ambassador for Christ, a dispenser of God�s truth to others. Our testimonies should be the truth we are to give to others. 2 Corinthians 3:2-3. The enemy wants desperately to divert us from our priority. And his major temptation in doing this, is to whisper in our ears; Christ is not coming back for a long time. There will be plenty of time to share the truth of God with others tomorrow; it is not a matter of urgency.
	How can we know when we are not being a faithful as servants? We will demonstrate the same symptoms as the wicked servant in the parable. Instead of being united in heart and spirit with God�s people and work, we will find ourselves being in conflict with other servants of the master. A critical spirit, bitterness, anger, desire to hurt and get revenge, these are the symptoms of those servants who have left the number one priority of feeding others. And we will also find ourselves becoming more and more like the world in our conduct and our character. Instead of being distinct and different as we conform to image of Jesus, we will find ourselves just blending more and more in with those who are the enemies of the cross.

	Knowing that Christ return will be sudden and unexpected should motivate us always to be prepared. We are not to use irresponsibility, sitting and waiting, doing nothing, seeking self serving pleasure, using this tarrying like an excuse not to do God�s work of building his kingdom, developing a false security based on precise calculations of events, or letting our curiosity about the end times divert us from doing God�s work.   

Prayer
Lord, erase every spirit of bitterness and anger in me, teach me to be faithful in all my endeavour before you in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: JOHN 15: 1-8
																																		KEY VERSE: JOHN 15:9-10
								As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father�s commandments, and abide in his love.

Christ is the vine, and God is the vine dresser who comes for the branches to make them fruitful. The branches are all those who claim to be followers of Christ. The fruitful branches are true believers who by their living union with Christ produce much fruit. But those who become unproductive, those who turn back from following Christ after making a superficial commitment, will be separated from the vine. Unproductive followers are as good as dead and will be cut off and tossed aside.
Jesus makes a distinction between two kinds of pruning: separating a cutting back branch. Fruitful branches are cut back to promote growth. In other words, God must sometimes discipline us to strengthen our character and faith. But branches that don�t bear fruit are cut off at the trump because not only are they worthless but they often effect the rest of the tree. People who won�t bear fruit for God or try to block the efforts of God�s followers will be cut off from his life giving power.
Many people try to be good, honest people who do what is right but Jesus says that the only way to live a true good life is to stay close to him, like a branch attached to the vine. Apart from Christ our efforts are unfruitful. When a vine bears much fruit, God is glorified, for daily he sent the sunshine and rain to make the crops grow, and constantly he nurtured each tiny plant and prepared it to blossom. What a moment of glory for the Lord of the harvest when the harvest is brought into the barns, mature and ready for use. God is glorified when we come into a right relationship with him and begin to bear much fruit. 
Abiding in Christ means believing that he is God�s Son. Receiving him as saviour and Lord. Doing what God says. Continuing to believe the gospel and relating in love to the community of believers, Christ body.

Prayer 
Lord, infuse in me every attribute and attitude needed for a genuine Christian to abide in you without questioning in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

	









APRIL 24  						                           HOLY GOD
	
																																	SCRIPTURE READING: DEUTERONOMY 4:15-40
																																				KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 6:3
					And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

The fact that God alone is God is a consistent theme of the bible. Although we humans seem unconvinced on the matter, God knows he is the only God, and that all other gods are human fabrications, fashioned as gods by our human hands or perceived as gods by our human minds.
We must remember that idol worship is not just keeping statues around the house, harmless lumps of clay, wood, or iron. It is the commitment to the other evil qualities, beliefs, and practices the idol represent or to strengths and attributes of mankind, the animal kingdom, or the orderliness of stars that were reverend without reference to God who created them.    
It is such a simple fact: God alone is God. This uniqueness of God is the essence of what we mean when we say God is holy. He is totally set apart. There are simply no other gods. And, because God knows this as an absolute fact, he also knows the futility and the stupidity of our human quest for and worship of other gods.
Primarily the meaning of holy is separate, to be distinct and morally pure. Habakkuk 1:13a. It means that the one who is holy is uniquely holy, with no competition or rivals. God is transcendentally separate. He is so far above and beyond us. 1 Samuel 2:2. God is holy in relation to every aspect of his nature and character; he is holy in a general sense. Christian should therefore be concerned with the holiness of God. For it is a matter of great importance to all living soul.
The bible underscores the importance of holiness to Christian and its impact on saints. In the case of holiness of God and Moses. Numbers 20:1-13, 27:12-14. Moses sinned and for that he was kept from entering the promise land. The act was striking the rock. Striking the rock was an act of disobedience, of failing to follow God�s instructions. It was identified by God as an act of unbelief. Who has not lost his or her temper and done worse than striking a rock? Yet this act was so serious in God�s sight that he forbade Moses to enter into the land of promise. He never saw the land to which became so close why? God told him, and he recorded it for us �Because you have not believed me, to treat me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel�. Numbers 20:12. 

Prayer 
Lord, help this generation to understand how holy and unique you are in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.








APRIL 25						                           HOLY LOVE

																										SCRIPTURE READING: DEUTERONOMY 6:4-9
																												KEY VERSE: ROMANS 8:28
					And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose

Many invent religion, believed in many God�s, but the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the God of the whole earth, the only true God. Because God alone is God, unique, one of a kind,  he demands from us a love that is for him alone and that excludes all other gods or god concepts that we might presume to embrace. He refuses to share our love with such non-existence useless god.
This love that God demands is not a warm, fuzzy, feeling, but an overwhelming commitment to God that include every aspect of our being, whole-hearted, focused love that is set apart for God alone. We will treasure his word in our hearts and apply it as relevant to every aspect of our lives, refuse to allow other gods. We will choose to honour him, obeying him rather than dishonour him by disobeying him and we will teach our children about him. Deuteronomy 6:7, 20, 25.
Spiritual relationship with God begins from within. Proverbs 4:23. Without one�s will, perceptions, passions, desires, affections and thoughts rightly aligned, the life of love is impossible. One of the few things that are so universal and challenging is love for God. There is no room for divided affections or allegiance. If indeed there is one God who stands supremacy powerful and valuable, this demands a supreme and total loyalty from you, a loyalty that starts with the heart.  

Prayer
Lord ,let my life experience your unconditional love, make the reason why you love me manifest in my life in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
















APRIL 26 						                           HOLY FAITH

																															SCRIPTURE READING: DEUTERONOMY 18:9-13 
																																		KEY VERSE: 2 PETER 1:5
							And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge
	
God alone is God. Not only is God totally unlike other �gods�, he is also totally unlike occult or psychic powers.
The Israelites were naturally curious about the occult practices of the Canaanite religions. But Satan is behind the occult, and God flatly forbade Israel to have anything to do with it. Today people are still fascinated by horoscope, fortune telling and witchcraft. Often their interest comes from a desire to know and control the future. But Satan is no less dangerous today than he was in Moses time. In the bible, God tells us all we need to know about what is going to happen. The information Satan offers is likely to be distorted or completely false, with the trust worthy guidance of the Holy Spirit through the bible and the church, we don�t need to turn to occult sources for faulty information. 
Because God alone is God, our faith is to be in him alone. Because God alone is God, we are forbidden to seek answers or guidance or interference from these occult and psychic powers. We are to trust God with our life and our future, and trust him in the inequalities and injustices of life. We are to have a holy faith that trusts exclusively in God, and in which we commit ourselves wholly into his keeping.

Prayer
Lord, make me solely believe in your strength and power in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

																																		KEY VERSE: I CORINTHIANS 12:7
								But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal
	
The spiritual gifts given to each person by the Holy Spirit are special abilities that are to be used to minister to the needs of believers. There are many gifts, people have different gifts, some more than one gift, and one gift is not superior to another. All spiritual gifts comes from the Holy Spirit, and their purpose is to build up Christ�s body, the church. But instead of building up and unifying churches and members the spiritual gifts is splitting it. It has become symbols of spiritual power, causing rivalries because some people thought they are more spiritual than others. This is a terrible misuse of spiritual gifts because their purpose is always to help the church function more effectively, not to divide it, we can be divisive if we insist on using our gift our own way without being sensitive to others. We must never use gifts as a means of manipulation others or serving our own self interest. No matter what gift(s) a person has, each gift is given by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit decides which gifts each one of us should have, we are responsible to use and sharpen our gift but we can take no credit for what God has freely given us. 
Paul compares the body of Christ to a human body. Each part has a specific function that is necessary to the body as a whole. The parts are different for a purpose, and in their differences they must work together.

Prayer
Lord, empower me with the gifts needed to effectively discharge my assignment on earth power in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.




















APRIL 28                                                                         ONE BODY MANY GIFT II	                                                              
	
									SCRIPTURE READING: 1 CORINTHIANS 12:13-25
																																		KEY VERSE: I CORINTHIANS 12:13
								For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one spirit.

Christians must avoid two common errors: being too proud of their abilities and thinking they have nothing to give to the body of Christ. Instead of comparing ourselves to one another, we should use our different gifts together to spread the good news of salvation. The church is composed of many types of people from a variety of back grounds with a multitude of gifts and abilities. It is easy for these differences to divide people, as was the case in Corinthian. But despite the differences, all believers have one thing in common- faith in Christ. On this essential truth the church finds unity. We are baptized by one Holy Spirit into one body of Christ, the church. We don�t lose our individual identities, but we have an overriding oneness in Christ. 
When a person becomes a Christian the Holy Spirit takes up residence, and he or she born into God�s family. We have all been made to drink into one spirit, means that the same Holy Spirit completely fills our inner most beings. We are members of God�s family, we may have different interest and gift, but we have a common goal. Each church member is important. If a seemingly insignificant part is taken away, the whole body become less effective. Thinking that your gift is more important than someone else�s is an expression of spiritual pride. We should not look down on those who seem unimportant, and we should not be jealous of others who have impressive gifts. Instead, we should use the gifts we have been given and encourage others to use theirs.

Prayer
Lord, help me not to see myself as all in all in utilizing my God given gift in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: GENESIS 24:1-15
																																		KEY VERSE: ISAIAH 7:11
						Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

Often before we make a major move in our lives we ask God for a sign. Asking God for a sign connotes that we want his answers before we move. Abraham oldest servant asked God for sign when the task of taking a wife for Isaac was on him. Obviously Eliezer had learned much about faith and about God from his master. Eliezer did not ask for a woman with looks or wealth, he simply ask God to show him a woman with an attitude of service, someone who would go beyond the expected. An offer to water his camels would indicate that kind of attitude. Asking God for sign on how to go about something in our life is good but the motive behind our asking for that sign means a lot. There is no guarantee that we can get anything we want simply by asking Jesus and believing. God does not grant requests that would hurt us or others or that would violate his own nature, his will and purpose for us. To be fulfilled, our requests must be in harmony with the will and purpose of God. The stronger our belief, the more likely our prayers will be in line with God�s will, and then God will be happy to grant them.
God want to help us, bless us and give us answers if it will glorify him and will accomplish his purposes. He want us to be totally dependent on him for direction and in everything in life. If we are asking God for a sign for ourselves, a selfish and pointless desire to know, than chances are that we won�t get any.  

Prayer
Lord, work on my unbelief, make me rest on you totally in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.

									SCRIPTURE READING: ROMANS 8:18-25
																																		KEY VERSE: ROMANS 8:18
								For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

				As Christian, we have wrestled with so many questions. Some become agnostics because they cannot come up with satisfactory answers to questions such as how a powerful and loving God can allow suffering in the world. All creation suffers because of mans fall in sin. When Adam and Eve fell into sin, God�s judgement on them included a judgement on creation. Sin has caused all creation to fall from the perfect state in which God created it. So the world is subject to frustration and bondage to decay so that it cannot fulfil its intended purpose. Christians see the world as it is, physically decaying and spiritually infected with sin. But we do not need to be pessimistic, because we have hope for future glory. When we receive the full redemption promised in Christ, all of creation will be restored at least to its original state. If not to an even greater level of glory. Isaiah 11:6-9.
We need to think biblically about suffering so that we will grow through it rather than be destroyed by it. When we process our thinking through the grid of biblical truth, we will not be devastated by our trials. We must resist the devil in time of trials by being firm in our faith and by understanding the biblical perspective of it. Remember your present suffering are relatively short compared to your eternal sharing in the glory of God. The weight of our present trials is like a feather on the scale, which can�t be compare with the tons of gold of glory that will be revealed to us. God has promised to return in power and glory to bring redemption to us and to judge our enemies. He has promised it, and he cannot lie. Think about to endure present, temporary suffering for future glory.

Prayer
Lord, let the revelation of your glory consume my fear, easy my suffering and console my heart in Jesus Christ Almighty name. Amen.
